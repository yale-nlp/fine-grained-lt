This review of 38 studies involving 7843 children found that asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department visits and hospital admissions. There were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits and fewer episodes of asthma exacerbations. However, there was no significant difference between education and control for other outcomes (FEV1, PEF, rescue medication use, quality of life or symptoms) and there was
We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint repair, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy
This review included five trials with 217 participants. One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune participants with blood-stage malaria showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced, but MSP/RESA vaccine did reduce the number of cases of malaria. No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg
Four studies, involving 125 participants, were included. Three studies evaluated pulsed electromagnetic fields and one study evaluated the effect of pulsed, capacitive coupled electric fields. Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations. The primary measure of the clinical effect of electromagnetic field stimulation was the proportion of participants whose fractures had united at a fixed time point, but most data related to non-union of the tibia. The overall pooled effect size was
We included 12 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1831 participants in this review. Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively. One trial including 199 participants were of low risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials compared drain versus no drain in 961 participants. The average age of participants ranged from 18 to 70 years. The duration of the trials ranged from one to three months. The length of hospital stay
Forty-nine randomised trials involving 3639 participants were included in this review. All trials were conducted and published in China. Thirty-eight different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including four single herbs, eight traditional Chinese patent medicines, and 26 self concocted Chinese herbal compound prescriptions. The trials reported on global symptom improvement (including improvement in numbness or pain) and changes in nerve conduction velocity. There was inadequate evidence to determine whether any of the herbal medicines used
This review included five randomised controlled trials involving 1382 patients. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0
We identified 12 randomised controlled trials involving 7,119 participants. Five trials showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher rate of IUD insertion compared with delayed insertion. One trial showed that there was no difference between the two groups in the rate of intrauterine insemination (i.e. implantation of an IUD into a woman's uterus). One trial found that there were no differences between the groups in terms of the number of women who had an
We found only one small trial published as an abstract in a medical journal. Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. The included study investigated the effects of meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk for attrition bias, which means that the results
We identified three randomised controlled trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of children who died or developed
We included 12 randomised controlled trials, with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic in one trial. All the trials were at high risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. Antifungal antibiotics are effective in preventing urinary tract infections in people with HIV/AIDS. There was no difference in the number of
We included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. The number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation. Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial and in the other trial there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who died or had a caesarean section. The quality of the evidence
The two methods of skin closure for caesarean that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Compared with absorbable staples (an absorbable, sterile, flexible thread prepared from either the serosal connective tissue layer of beef or the submucosal fibrous tissue of sheep intestine), non-absorable staples are associated with similar incidence of wound infection and wound complication. However, skin separation was
We identified 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 821 participants, two awaiting classification and one ongoing trial. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules. Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials. No studies reported on adverse effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of
This review found two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 23 participants that compared azathiopine with placebo or no treatment in people with COPD. One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain. Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to
We included 56 studies with a total of 4068 participants in this review, with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer. A meta-analysis, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention in reducing fatigue data. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the proportion of participants who reported fatigue at
We searched the medical literature up to May 2015 and found five trials that met our inclusion criteria. We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses. These trials were co-ordinated in Germany and included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We found that HD9 and HD14 trials were similar in terms of the number of people who died from any cause, but there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in
We included 15 studies including 1835 cancer patients in this review. All included studies were conducted in high-income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven studies) or prostate cancer (two studies). Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar rates of similar RTW rates for patients receiving psychosocial interventions and patient education compared with patient education alone. We judged six studies to have
We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by a Scottish government agency. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not report funding sources. We found no new trials in this update. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials compared different durations of dosing of oxytoc
We included 32 studies in this review. Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). It was not possible to pool any of the data because each study compared different culture media. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. Four of these studies found no evidence of a difference between the media compared, for either day three or day five embryo transfer. One of these
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of different methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communication to women with breast cancer. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area. The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left
We included 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1006 participants in this review. One of these studies was an update of a previously included study, with the one new study contributing an additional 113 participants. There was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months follow-up of the intervention. This was maintained from three to nine months afterwards. There were also a significant increase in the number of chest-free days (the number of days in which
We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of people who died or had serious adverse events between the two groups. We did not find any evidence of differences in the proportion of patients who had a serious
We included two studies in the review and a third was identified as ongoing. The two included studies employed multi-component community-based interventions tailored to the specific cultural aspects of the population and were based in Native American populations (1505 participants in total). No difference was observed in weekly smoking at 42 months follow-up in the one study assessing this outcome (skills-community group versus control group; risk ratio [RR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.78
We found one trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). The trial reported no maternal mortality occurring in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. There were few events for most of the reported outcomes and the results were generally imprecise. Very low-quality evidence indicated no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, or any other important outcomes. The trial was at unclear risk of bias. There was no
We identified 67 randomised clinical trials involving a total of 6197 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 5771 participants from 64 trials provided data for one or more outcomes included in this review. There was no evidence of difference in most of the comparisons in most comparisons, and where there was, these differences were in single trials. There were no differences in the number of people who died from any cause between the two groups, and there were no
Twenty-three trials involving 724 people were included in this review. There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids (improvement rate 44%, 95 CI 28 to 59%), oral PUVA (improment rate 26 to 62%), and combination of PUVA and retinoid treatment is better than the individual treatment. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether PUVA is superior to individual treatment in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and adverse events. The quality of the
We found nine trials that evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162
We included 58 trials with 2849 participants in this review. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All the trials except one trial with 30 participants were at high risk of bias. The trials compared intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants) for one or more of the outcomes. There was no difference in the number of people who died or had serious adverse
We identified 74 unique studies as eligible for this review and categorized them according to the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (fromP. falciparum), pLDH (from P. leptospirosis) and other types of malaria. Types 4 and 5 included P. florida. In comparisons with microscopy, we identified 71 evaluations of Type 1 tests, eight evaluations of type 2 tests and five evaluations of
We found five studies that tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. All five studies were conducted in the UK, and tested the effects of changing the length of the consultation. Overall, our confidence in the results was very low; most studies had a high risk of bias, particularly due to non-random allocation of participants and the absence of data on participants' characteristics and small sample sizes. We are uncertain whether altering appointment length increases primary care consultation length,
The evidence is current to January 2015. We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the effects of ART versus placebo or no treatment. All three trials were conducted in developed countries. A total of 157 participants were recruited to the trials. The average age of the participants ranged from 24 to 92 years and more than 79% of them were male. The studies were at a high risk of bias
We found 10 studies (n = 1658 participants). Six of the studies included recruitment manoeuvres as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that was different from control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (such as mode of ventilation, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and low tidal volume or plateau pressure). Six studies reported mortality (all deaths) and five studies reported morbidity (deaths due to any cause). Five studies reported
Fifteen studies, involving 687 participants, were included in the review. Study quality was poor and sample sizes were frequently small. Three studies measured our primary outcome but individually did not report significant differences between treatment and control. However, some pooled effects were analysed. The use of 'as needed' medications was reduced in two studies, (47 patients), by relaxation therapy. There was no significant difference in FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expir
We found 35 studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest (antidepressant and benzodiazepine as monotherapy) were included in this review; however, since studies addressed many different comparisons, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes for primary outcome. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressant and benzidiazepine in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval ranges (CI)
Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included in this review. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality, but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death. Endoscopic stenting was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.86) when compared with surgery. The risk of
We included five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants. Four trials compared ultrasound guidance with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (RR 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCT
We found one small randomised controlled trial (80 male students) conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009 and three ITS studies in Canadian provinces. The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men who were exposed to films with a high alcohol content. Young men also drank less when exposed to commercials for alcohol compared with those exposed to those with a neutral content. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we
Eight randomized trials involving 182 infants were included in this review. There was no evidence of a difference in short-term growth parameters when high and low MCTs were compared. Length gain in g/d based on five studies showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31). Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a WMD -1.35 g/kg/
We found one small trial (with data from 34 participants) comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with no amniocentesis. The trial was considered to be at a high risk of bias overall, due to small numbers of participants, inconsistency in the reporting and lack of information on blinding (receiving). Meta-analysis was not possible. There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who had a caesare
This review identified three studies, with a total of 1620 participants. The sensitivity of the Mini-Cog in the individual studies was reported as 0.99, 0.76 and 0.83. There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies which precluded a pooled meta-analysis of the results of the studies. There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the diagnostic test in community settings. The limited number of studies and the methodological limitations that are present in
We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamine: dexamphetamine (10.2 mg/d to 21.8 mg daily), lisdexamfetamine (30 mg to 70 mg daily) and mixed amphetamine salts (12.5 mg to 80 mg daily). These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%). Eighteen
We included 10 studies (811 participants) in this review update. The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic pain conditions that were investigated, the dose of vitamin D given, co-interventions, and the outcome measures reported. Overall, there was no consistent pattern that vitamin D treatment was associated with greater efficacy than placebo in any chronic pain condition. Adverse events and withdrawals were not reported. Only two studies reported responder pain outcomes; the other studies reported
Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were RCTs, 12 were CBAs, and two were ITS. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of intervention, participants, settings and outcomes. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational interventions, in nine they were targeted at the organisation of care, and 20 studies targeted both. In
This review included five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 participants. The trials compared the following methods of birth control: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 µg/day versus LNG-IUS 12 µg; LNG
This review included 42 trials of immunotherapy for house mite allergy; 27 pollen allergy; two Cladosporium mould allergy, two latex allergy and six trials looking at multiple allergen allergys; 10 animal dander allergy trials; and six trial looking at different types of plant allergy. Concealment of allocation of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 16 of these trials. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of people who developed allergic reactions
We found six studies involving 1297 patients. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk (RR) (RR = 0.5) of 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 0.9) of 1.0 (95%) for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Mortals were also significantly reduced in patients who received a combination of mechanical ventilation and mechanical ventilation. The
We included 15 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1833 participants in this review. We found that time to emergence from anaesthesia, that is, time needed to follow verbal commands, was longer with isoflurane than with propofol (mean difference (MD) -3.29 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.18,
Four trials including 15,936 hypertensive subjects were identified. Average age was 75.4 years. Mean blood pressure at entry was 171/86 mmHg. The combined results from the three trials reporting change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) did not indicate a benefit from treatment and placebo (236/7767 versus 259/7660, Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95% CI 0.30, 0.53). Both syst
We included 12 trials enrolling 3474 patients in this review. The overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data; however, the authors determined that this would be unlikely to impact negatively as most data were objective. There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re-stenosis rates at six months and
Three randomised controlled trials (333 participants) were identified, two of which were multicentre trials comprising only participants positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The other study enrolled participants clinically diagnosed with bronchiolitis from a hospital in Italy. All studies used 2.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of nebulised rhDNase compared with placebo either as a daily or a twice daily dose. Adjunctive therapy used together with the primary
We found two studies with a total of 181 participants, 116 undergoing the percutaneous technique and 65 treated by cut-down femoral artery access. One study had a small sample size and did not adequately report method of randomisation, allocation concealment or pre-selected outcomes. The second study was a larger study with few sources of bias and good methodology. We observed no significant difference in mortality between groups, with only one death occurring overall, in the totally percutaneously group
This review found that the sponge was significantly less effective in preventing pregnancy than was the diaphragm in both trials. In the larger USA trial, the 12-month cumulative life-table termination rates per 100 women for overall pregnancy were 17.4 for the sponge and 12.8 for the diapragm. The rates were 24.5 for the sponges in the UK trial and 10.9 in the USA trial. There was no difference in the number of
Sixteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included. Three studies investigated preventative measures and three studies investigated amelioration. Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta-analysis was not possible. Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevention of cognitive deficits compared with placebo, and d-threo-methylphenidate HCL (considered to be a rare type of chronic leukemia; it characterized by
This review included two randomised controlled trials with 26 analysed participants. The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years. Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury. Both studies assessed as at high risk of bias. Patient-reported altered sensation was partially reported in one study and fully reported in another. There was no significant difference in the number of participants who reported improvement in
We found two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) that met our inclusion criteria. However, the two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate. One trial (involving 161 pregnancies) was based on women with a history of diabetes. It showed no statistically significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for all our proposed primary outcomes, namely, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy,
We found fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6-8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-
This review found nine randomised controlled trials (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) that compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none of the studies combined ibuproxen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks (behavior) with single doses of medication. The results of these studies showed that, compared to placebo or no treatment at all, single doses (200 mg or 400 mg) were effective in relieving pain
We included 43 randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 3497 participants with dry eye. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials compared different treatments for dry eye, including topical corticosteroids, topical ointment, and a combination of topical oints and ointments. We found no evidence that any of the treatments were better than the other in terms of the number of participants who had dry eye
This review found only one randomised controlled trial in 136 patients that compared the effect of maintaining lamivudine in second-line regimens or not in their subsequent regimens. There was no difference in virological outcomes in the group who maintained lamivUDine and those who did not in the subsequent regimen. Two other small observational studies reported in abstract form also did not report a difference in the proportion of those with viral suppression after six months and time to HIV-
We included 133 studies involving 844,206 participants in this review. We found that difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard for difficult laryngoscopy in 92 studies, difficult tracheal intubation in 50 studies, and failed intubations in two studies; we mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection for the different domains. Difficult face masks ventilation was associated with a lower risk of death and a higher risk of serious adverse events than difficult face
This review found that probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea and the end of the illness, although the size of the effect varied considerably between studies. No adverse events were attributed to the probiotic intervention. The trials were undertaken in a wide range of different settings and also varied greatly in organisms tested, dosage, and participants' characteristics. Probiotics were not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events.
We found only one study that compared nidotherapy-enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants). The duration of the included study was 18 months in total. The single study was classified by its authors as a 'pilot study'. The study examined the short-term (up to six months) and long-term outcomes of people with acute myeloid leukaemia. The study did not report on quality of life, mortality or quality of hospital stay.
We found eight studies with 3283 participants. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily or placebo) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses
We included one randomised controlled trial (involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia at term) in this review. The trial did not report any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes. There was no significant difference between magnesium sulphate and placebo in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (risk ratio (RR) 1.0) and was at a low risk of bias. There were no serious adverse events reported in either group.
Four studies met all of the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review. Two studies used combination therapies consisting of a pharmacotherapy combined with cognitive and behavioural therapies, whilst the remaining two used counselling through text message support and the other delivered via clinic doctors trained in smoking cessation techniques. Smoking cessation data were pooled across all studies producing a statistically and clinically significant effect in favour of the intervention (risk ratio 1.43, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.
We included 13 studies (5686 patients) in this review. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day or ICU mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (two studies) to be at high risk of bias. We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection for selection, attrition and reporting bias. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries, and
Six studies (n = 478) of variable quality were included. A composite outcome of Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Neonatal Facial Action Coding System (NFCS) and/or Premature Interventions Profile (PIPP) score was reported in 288 infants, who did not receive a sweet tasting solution. Cry characteristics favoured the venepuncture group but the differences were reduced by the provision of the sweet tasting solutions. The average number of skin punctures
This review identified two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry. Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95%
We included 18 studies involving 2521 participants. The methodological quality of 17 included studies was poor. Only three indicated that compared with antiviral drugs, Chinese medicinal herbs may be effective in preventing influenza and alleviating influenza symptoms. 'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and speeding recovery in one study although no data were reported. There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin in treating influenza
We included 8 studies with a total of 580 participants in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study), low dose versus high dose (1), short versus long treatment (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1) and exchange with and without angioplasty (1). No two studies compared the same intervention. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no evidence
We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons published) published time-to-event data. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96
Ten random or quasi-random controlled trials reported on a total of 1896 patients. There was no statistically significant effect on inpatient mortality (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.16) or mortality to longest follow up (OR 0.92, 95%.). Discharge to institutional care was reduced for the NLU but functional status at discharge was increased for the SMD. The quality of the included studies was low or very low.
We included 11 studies including 414 participants in the review. Two trials compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound regimen with another, and six compared ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention with another non-surgical intervention (for example, exercises and splint). The risk of bias was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only two reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed and six reporting that participants were blinded. The evidence is current to
We included eight studies involving approximately 10,000 participants in this review. The active interventions were pravastatin, atorvastatin (a statin drug that lowers blood cholesterol), simvastatins, clofibrate, and conjugated oestrogen. Fixed-effect analysis showed no overall effect on stroke recurrence but statin therapy alone had a marginal benefit in reducing subsequent cerebrovascular events in those with a previous history of stroke or
The evidence is current to May 2015. We included 11 studies in this review. Studies differed in design, settings, duration, content and intensity of intervention, length of follow-up, methods of evaluation and also in definitions and measures of smoking behaviour used. We found that in the California and Massachusetts statewide tobacco control campaigns, smoking prevalence was significantly lower than in the rest of the USA. In the same studies, smoking rates were also significantly lower in the Massachusetts and California campaigns.
We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life in the short term (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduce fatigue, reduce sleep disturbances and reduce excessive daytime somnolence (sleep apnea
We found one study that compared post-operative imaging within 48 hours with no early post-operative imaging among 125 people who had surgery for glioblastoma grade 4. Most patients in the study underwent maximal surgical resection followed by combined radiotherapy and temozolomide. The study was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study did not report on the number of people who died or had complications related to
We included three studies randomising 161 people with schizophrenia. Data were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes. Clinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups at eight weeks. There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes. The number of participants with parkinsonism was similar (2 studies, 70 participants) and numbers of participants
Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion in this review. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical recurrence and endoscopic recurrence. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events. Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrence (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) compared to placebo. Probiotics were not superior
We included seven trials (825 participants). The psychosocial interventions considered in the studies were: cognitive-behavioural coping skills training, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, and brief motivational interviewing. Two studies were considered in two comparisons: twelve-step programme (one study) and brief intervention (three studies). There were no data for the secondary outcome, alcohol-related harm. The quality of the evidence was low or unclear. We judged the majority of the trials to have
We identified 23 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1586 participants. Fifty-eight per cent of these participants were from five unpublished studies. Quinine was compared to placebo (20 trials, 510 participants), vitamin E (four trials, 543), a quinine-vitamin E combination (three trials, 1140), theophylline (one trial, one participant) or
We identified seven randomised controlled trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramp (202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (322). Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial. For women with nocturnal leg cramps, differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not
We found one study that compared a six-month, home-based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA. The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but 50% of them did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. The study did not report on quality of life, disability, or death. The quality of the evidence was low
Two trials (N = 149) were included. One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups. The other trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy) also found no significant difference between surgery and conservative treatment. In both trials,
Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, five RCTs, one CCT and three ITSs. Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by clinic clerk. Three of five studies found a decrease in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations. Two studies reported no difference between the groups. Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits. One study found no difference in visits between the two groups.
We included 84 studies (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias. At four or more months, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.11, 95% confidence
This review includes 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 2210 participants. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition bias, and at high risk for biases associated with blinding. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect (caused by the small number of studies and the
We found three small randomised controlled trials, involving 226 participants. One trial included patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without computerised tomography (CT) verification, and the other two trials included patients who had CT-verified ICH. Data on the primary outcome measure (death and dependency) were not available in any of the trials. Death and disability could be calculated in the larger ICH-verified trial, and in the smaller trial, death and disability were not measured
Six trials were identified, with 425 patients randomized to D-penicillamine and 258 to placebo. A statistically significant benefit was observed when compared to placebo for all three-dose ranges and for most outcome measures including: tender joint counts, pain, physician's global assessments and ESR. The standardized weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo in moderate dose ranges were -0.51 [95% CI -1.88, -0] for tender joint count, 0.56
We found four relevant trials. All of them were of low quality. All four studies used a decoction containing Huangqi compounds as the intervention with chemotherapy. The intervention groups of three studies were compared to a chemotherapy alone control group, the fourth study was compared to two other Chinese herbal interventions (investigations by nurses designed to test a hypothesized cause effect relation by modifying the supposed causal factor in the study). None of the studies reported on primary outcome using Common Toxicity
We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. The three trials included a total of 866 participants aged four to 55 years. One trial evaluated the effect of vitamin A alone, one trial evaluated DHA alone, and a third trial evaluated vitamin A plus DHA. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials included participants with RP of all forms of genetic predisposition
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. The duration or dose of the interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits
We identified three eligible studies that included a total of 285 preterm infants (140 received arginine and 140 received a placebo) from three countries. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found evidence that arginines reduce the risk of NEC in preterm babies. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as required to prevent the development of NEC was reduced by 27% in the group receiving arginamines compared with the placebo group. The
We found four studies involving 1943 participants with acute sinusitis. The trials were well-designed and double-blind and studied INCS (cytotoxic) versus placebo or no intervention for 15 or 21 days. Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on improvement of symptoms or complete relief: for mometasone furoate 400 µg versus 200 µg, participants receiving INCS were more likely to experience resolution or improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo
The administration of vancomycin in low doses reduces the incidence of both total neonatal sepsis and coagulase negative staphylococcal infections in eligible preterm infants. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the risks of development of resistant organisms in the nurseries involved in these trials, as the blood cultures drawn from central lines may have failed to grow due to the methodologies used in these studies. The use of prophylactic vancom
This review of 13 randomised controlled trials found that plaster cast applied to an amputation stump accelerated wound healing compared with elastic compression, WMD -25.60 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -49.08 to -2.12 days (1 trial). There were no statistically significant differences in healing for other dressing comparisons. There was a single small trial of aloe vera supplementation compared with gauze. The results of this trial are un interpretable since
We found 11 studies that included 1482 women. Five studies were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014. Four studies examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). We found two studies of progestin-only pills and two of the etonogestrel implant. Most studies did not report significant differences between the study arms on the results of breastfeeding
We found 10 controlled trials from Australia, Singapore, Singapore and the USA that met our inclusion criteria. We grouped them according to the extent to which they adjusted for regression to the mean (RTM) and spillover effects. Two studies that partially adjusted for both reported a rate of 0.71 (95% CI 0.55, 0.93); for three studies, the rate was 0.80. One study that made no adjustments had a higher rate of 1.
Four trials involving 494 participants were included in this review. Three studies involving 383 participants provided data on the proportion of participants who had achieved a therapeutic INR by day five. One study showed significant benefit of a 10-mg warfarin nomogram for the proportion who achieved an anticoagulant INR of at least 90% in the first five days of treatment. The other two studies showed no significant benefit for the number of participants achieving an INR above 90
We included seven trials with a total of 555 participants. Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatrician-led care in-hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. One trial compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with standard care. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data are limited. The evidence is current to May 2015
We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 840 participants. The evidence is current to May 2015. The studies were of varied quality and included a variety of interventions and outcomes. Three studies reported a reduction in parental anxiety and improvement in child behaviours in three studies. Also, better parental coping and family functioning was reported in one study. Home care was reported as more costly for service
We included 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 7524 participants in this review. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. We found data relevant to two comparisons when ICM was compared with standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. The evidence is current to January 2016. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. The main limitations of this review
Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. All but one trial were at high risk of bias. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. There was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of the trials due to any reason. There were no deaths in the trials. There is insufficient
This review found two randomised clinical trials that compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone and saline. One trial compared bile lavage versus saline in 17 patients. The other trial compared saline lavage and bile solution with hydroxide. The results of this trial showed that bile solutions did not improve cholangiographic improvement in patients with biliary cirrhosis. There was no difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of patients
This review of 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that early nutritional support was associated with a lower risk of death or disability compared to delayed nutritional support. There was no difference in the risk of disability at the end of follow-up. However, there was a higher risk of adverse events such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain in the early intervention group compared to the delayed intervention group. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing of
We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis. Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions drank approximately 23 g alcohol per week less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). The main source of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36
We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepine and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomly allocated to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzod
We found 13 small trials (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials. Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney disease. The duration and style of tai chi differed between trials, and some studies were at risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies). All studies had at least one domain with
Twenty-seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the
We found three studies that compared dexamethasone to placebo (a fake medication) in 451 participants with schizophrenia. The duration of the studies ranged from seven to 14 days. The studies were small, with a mean age of 51 to 280 participants. We found no data on nausea intensity. Corticosteroid therapy was compared with a number of other medications, including metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, tropisetron, and dexametron.
We included 10 studies of high-risk children using antibiotics to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV-infected children (1345), four cystic fibrosis and one each sickle cell disease (219), cancer and low birth weight infants with underlying respiratory disorders (40). The study duration ranged from seven days to seven years. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe and the United States. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 519 participants, comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum: nitrous oxide (three trials), helium (five trials), or room air (one trial), or carbon dioxide (100 participants).   Three trials were compared to carbon dioxide, and one trial was compared to nitrogen oxide (N2O). The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of deaths
This review found 14 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating the effect of dexamethasone on the risk of developing BPD. Eight studies enrolling a total of 303 participants investigated the cumulative dosage administered; three studies compared a high versus a moderate dose and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dose. Analysis of the studies investigating a moderate-dose versus a high-dose regimen showed an increased
This review included eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people with Crohn's disease. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2000. The trials compared corticotrophin, cortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone, hydrocortisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus no treatment, placebo or no treatment. The evidence is current to January 2015. The review
We included six studies with a total of 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies that assessed insecticide spray as a fly control measure found that trachoma is reduced by at least 55% to 61% with this measure compared to no intervention. However, another study did not find insecticides spray to be effective in reducing trachomas. Another study found that health education with modest water and latrine provision reduced the incidence of cholera by 29.5
Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT, with 40% of participants showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care. Findings at follow-up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants
This review included one randomised controlled trial including 46 people with sickle cell disease. Of the 46 enrolled participants, seven withdrew before randomisation leaving 39 participants who were randomised to receive oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or placebo (n = 20) for six weeks and were follow up to six months. Two participants from the treatment group have missing values of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, therefore the number of samples analysed was
This review includes only one randomised controlled trial, funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellow Fellowship. This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years. The study compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) and the Rapid Syll
We found four randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that randomised 268 participants to receive either trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol or placebo (dummy treatment). The trials were conducted in Brazil in both adults and children. In all four studies, antibiotics were given orally. One study was at high risk of bias and was judged to be at risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias
We included 43 trials containing predominantly older people with mainly trochanteric fractures. Twenty-two trials (3749 participants) compared the Gamma nail with the sliding hip screw (SHS). The Gamma nail was associated with increased risk of operative and later fracture of the femur and increased reoperation rate. There were no major differences between implants in wound infection, mortality or medical complications. Five trials (623 participants) showed no difference in fracture fixation complications, mortality, reoperation
We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. It analysed retrospective data for 47 women who received either palliative surgery or medical management with Octreotide (n = 20) and reported overall survival and perioperative mortality and morbidity. Women with poor performance status were excluded from surgery. Although six (22%) women who had surgery died, there was no difference in the number of women who died after surgery between those who received surgery and those who had medical management
This review included four randomised controlled trials with 244 women with PCOS receiving 12 weeks or 6 weeks of treatment. Two trials (184 women) studied the effects of simvastatin and two trials (60 women randomised) looked at the effects on body mass index (BMI). There was no good evidence that statins improve menstrual regularity, spontaneous ovulation rate, hirsutism or acne, either alone or in combination with the combined oral contraceptive pill (OC
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the use of local or radiotherapy for palliative control of vaginal bleeding in women with cervical cancer. Since the last version of this review, we found no new studies. We identified only observational data from single-arm studies of women treated with formalin-soaked packs, interventional radiology, radiotherapy or other types of
This review found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling a total of 745 patients, that investigated temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme. The evidence is current to May 2015. The results of the three RCTs suggest that the combination of temozomide and radiotherapy may increase the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients
We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. The findings of one study conducted in Cambodia provide low quality evidence that private contracts with international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for district health systems ('contracting-in') may improve health care access and utilization. In three countries, contracting-in increased use of antenatal care by 28% and use of public facilities by 14%. In the other study, intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve district health system managers�
We included three studies that involved 123 people. The methods used for blinding the participants and researchers to the treatment group were not reported, but as the comparison is surgical treatment with medical treatment, this bias is hard to avoid. All three studies reported on mortality, and death occurred in two studies. There was no clear evidence of a difference in mortality between treatment and control groups, or among treatment and treated patients. The number of people who died was similar in the surgical and medical treatment groups.
Cerivastatin is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent that has been used for more than 30 years to treat high blood cholesterol in people with and without cardiovascular disease. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found 50 trials that evaluated the dose-related efficacy of the drug in 12,877 participants who had their LDL cholesterol measured. The participants were of any age with or without heart disease and the trials studied the effects of the drugs within a treatment period of three to 12
We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants), two (9 studies, 770 participants) and three (6 studies, 417 participants) favoured remote iscaemic precondsitioning. However, there was a small increase in the number of patients who had a
We included 12 trials with 703 participants in this review. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions): a fatigue intervention, a Chinese herbal intervention and a placebo intervention. The evidence is current to
We identified three randomised controlled trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants for hyperkalaemia. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12, 19 and 40 infants enrolled. The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical quality. In none of the trials could we
Twelve randomised controlled trials were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review. Seven trials with 536 participants with PE were included in the review. In five trials, IVIg was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 623 severely affected participants. The mean difference (MD) of change in a seven-grade disability scale after four weeks was 4.5 points. In the other five trials with a total of 623 participants, the mean difference was
We included 28 randomised clinical trials (9330 participants) with an overall low risk of bias. In the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that a high proportion of inspired air was not associated with an increased risk of death from any cause (all-cause mortality). However, there was a small increase in the risk of
Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion for inclusion in this review. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time point for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in the number of children who died from any cause between children who received
Twelve studies were included, nine RCTs and three before and after studies. Only one study explored all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease as endpoints. Pooling of the seven studies in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI 0.07 to 0.72) for patients assigned to a low protein
We found 19 studies involving 3480 people. Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system. Most studies were conducted in the USA and included people with predominantly mild brain injury. The evidence suggests that most people made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific interventions. For people with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation,'strong evidence' showed that more intensive programmes are associated with
We included one randomised controlled trial (involving 176 women) in this review. This trial included four groups with a factorial design. We combined three of the groups as the intervention (rooming-in group) and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair-wise comparison. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trial found no evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of the number of
We found eight trials involving 660 participants. Seven of the eight studies were of poor quality. Follow-up time was less than one month in six trials. Only two trials provided data for the number of participants who were dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment, indicating a significantly lower rate of death and dependency in the sanchi group than in the control group (relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.45 to
This review found that there is no evidence to support the use of an immediate placement of a perimplant in the upper front teeth of children and adolescents. However, there is some evidence to suggest that an immediate implant may be more appropriate than a delayed implant. Further research is needed to determine the best timing of placement of perimplants.
Two trials were identified. One trial compared clioquinol with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog) score) between the active treatment and placebo group at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change from baseline was not significant. There were no significant differences in the number of people who developed dementia. The other
We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes). Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants, and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (OR 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high
We included 22 trials involving a total of 2193 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm, forearm or elbow surgery. Nine trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR) of two to three) and in primary operative failure (ROC) of one to two hours after surgery. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of participants who required re-admission to hospital.
We included three studies in this review. All used beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily delivered by dry powder Diskhaler to treat children with mild-moderate asthma. Study duration was 7-12 months. The average decrease in linear growth was -1.54 cm per year in children treated with the drug compared to those receiving placebo or non-steroidal asthma therapy. There was no significant difference in the number of children who developed asthma exacerbations. In children
This review found that APD did not differ from CAPD with respect to mortality (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.37), risk of peritonitis (RR 0.75, 95%. interval 0.50 to 1.11), switching from original PD to a different dialysis modality (RR 2.26, 95.26 to 5.02), hernias (RR 3.50, 95%, interval 1.32 to
This review of 37 trials (9312 patients) found that CRT was superior to RT in terms of OS, PFS, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OR) and SM. However, CRT is associated with a higher risk of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness and fatigue. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CRT for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
We found 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled a total of 4893 participants. Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered oral (22.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22.9 to 25.9%) or transdermal (5.5% to 10.5%) (number of study treatments: 12, 3040),
We found only one randomised controlled trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.3 years and were all male. The trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered twice daily) with placebo (a dummy pill) and found no difference in the number of ulcers
We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people. Four trials compared email to standard mail and two compared email and usual care to usual care. For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail (OR 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.24). For the secondary outcome of patient or caregiver uptake of health services, there were no differences between the groups (OR 1.
The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual vertigo symptoms. Pooled data identified a significant difference in conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. In the experimental group 88.7%
Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. All participants also received antibiotics. There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, 109 participants), (2) polypectomy (two studies, 87 participants), and (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid
We included eight trials (709 participants). Seven trials were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem. Four trials compared the effect of zinc-fortified staple food with unfortified food (comparison 1), and four compared the effects of zinc in combination with other nutrients/factors with the same food containing other nutrients or factors without zinc. The evidence is current to May 2015. The
Eleven studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants were included in this review. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival (HR 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants) and increased clinical progression (one year: risk ratio 1.25, 95-CI 1.08 to 1,25, three studies, 1336 participants), as well as mortality (RR 1.26,
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the use of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in women with breast cancer at 13 years of age. We found eight eligible trials. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with
We included four studies, with a total of 522 women, in the review. One of these studies did not report outcomes per woman randomised, and so was not included in formal analysis. Three studies only included women with PCOS (N = 122), while this was an exclusion criteria in the fourth study. One study investigated 20,000 units of human chorionic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (hCG) priming compared to no priming. The quality
This review found that both ERT and HRT were effective in preventing cognitive impairment after five and four years of treatment, respectively (odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.54 respectively). However, there was no effect of either ERT or HRT on prevention of cognitive impairment over time. There was no evidence of a difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of women who developed cognitive impairment at the end of treatment. The
We included two studies with 880 participants. Both studies lasted 12 weeks. The studies enrolled participants with both partially reversible and non-reversible COPD and baseline mean per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) of 43.4 to 49.6. Both included studies used the same combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily
This review included four short-term randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 169 participants. Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from a single placebo-controlled trial available for analysis. The results of the RCTs suggested that fluoxetine and clomipramine were superior to placebo in terms of symptom severity, as well as in the two CBT trials. Symptom severity was
This review included three trials that examined cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 268 adults. The trials found a beneficial effect of using a desensitization protocol over a rechallenge protocol at six months of follow-up for preventing discontinuation of treatment with corticosteroids. No severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred for either protocol in the three studies. In the small trials included in this review, when compared to a cotinine re-challenge,
We included three trials enrolling 148 preterm infants. Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group than in the placebo group. Duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the sedation group compared with the placebo (WMD 5.4 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 10.5 days). However, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of this drug in this population. The
Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment. No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhea at five to seven days after the treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants); very low quality evidence). No difference in the number of people
We included 23 studies (n = 4192) assessing the accuracy of IL-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adult patients. Twenty studies that were awaiting classification are awaiting classification. The included participants were heterogeneous in terms of their distribution of age, gender, main diagnosis, setting, country, and origin of infection, among other factors. We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias due to issues related to the index test domain in QUADAS-
We included 29 randomised controlled trials (5718 participants). All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification, five trials that involved people undergoing what was considered 'contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Four trials compared
We found two randomised controlled trials that compared oral 100 microgram (µg) selenium yeast tablets with placebo, taken from the first trimester until birth. One trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women. Sixty-one women completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and 44 of them completed an EDS questionnaire. The other trial randomly assigned 179 women to each of the two treatment groups. The trials were conducted in
We identified 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion duration (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak dose (5280 participants). Seven studies were RCTs addressing different anthracycline infusion duration. The majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. We identified long-term follow-up data for one of the studies in this update. The evidence is current to May 2015. For different anthrilacyclines peak dose, we identified a statistically
We included 37 eligible trials with a total of 3110 randomised participants; nine of these were new studies since the last update (2009) and five studies had been previously excluded but were re-assessed and included during the 2017 update. Studies included both adults and children with TBI. Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours. Thirty-three studies reported data for mortality, 31 studies
We found three high-quality and three low-quality studies involving 519 people with depression. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3, except for moderate evidence on the non-combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression
Three trials involving a total of 206 participants were included, all patients with vascular dementia. All three included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. When analysing these trials together, there was significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function measured by MMSE (WMD 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.66). No data on behaviour and death at the end of treatment were available from the included trials. Two trials
This review included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 960 participants. The quality of the evidence was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants with drains inserted. The mean length of hospital stay, reported in four trials consisting of 600 participants, was shorter in the drainage group. The risk of seroma formation was reduced in the
We found eight studies with 390,769 participants. Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one was a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The methodological quality was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The evidence for Isoflavones, Flavonols, Flavones and Flavanones was of medium quality. There was no evidence that total flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal
We included seven trials with 1369 participants. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials used the second definition. None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes. However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26.8%); risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI
Only two studies (34 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Both studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic cancer. The overall risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the second study. The mean probability of unresectable disease after CT scan across studies was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after computed tomography
We included 34 studies with a total of 2169 participants with blepharitis included in this review. Twenty studies (1661 participants) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharyngitis (MGD) and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior or mixed MGD. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the upper eyelids. Top
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared photodynamic therapy with no treatment in children with severe RRP. We found only one trial with a total of 23 participants. This study was at high risk of bias and only one of our secondary outcomes (reduction in volume of disease, assessed endoscopically) was measured in the study. There was no significant difference between
We found 42 studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast). These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the blinding of either the index test or the reference standard was not
We included seven studies, with 766 participants. All reported on low back pain in labour only. Four studies used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous, and one both. All studies reported treatment group mean or median scores, finding greater reduction in pain for sterile water. However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain intensity or relief, and use of different scales, meant meta-analysis was inappropriate. There was no significant difference between sterile water and saline for rates of
Twelve trials with a total of 1932 participants were included in this review. The overall postoperative chronic pain in the glue group was reduced by 37% (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; 10 studies, 1418 participants). Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups. However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh. Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed the reduction
We found 32 studies addressing technical editing and 66 surveys of reference accuracy. Only three of the studies were randomised controlled trials. More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references in two studies and improved reporting quality in another two studies, while another study showed mixed results after stricter editorial policies were introduced. Providing instructions to authors was associated with improved reporting of ethics requirements in one study and fewer errors and fewer references in another study. A 'package' of largely unspecified
We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain due to diverse types of malignancy. All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. Twelve studies used codeine as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only one reported results for treatment periods separately. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality,
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial) of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal, aged six to 35 years old. The majority of participants were African-American. Interventions ranged from one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks. The duration of the interventions ranged from six weeks to one year. The average age of the participants ranged from 18 to 65 years.
This review included six randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2411 participants. All six studies included adult participants between 16 and 80 years old, and treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures; the other five trials included people with focal onset seizures only. Participants receiving brivaracetam add-on were significantly more likely to experience a
We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine decisions among some parents. In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting. Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions. Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination. We found no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in the proportion of parents who were satisfied with
We identified 10 trials, with a total of 599 anorexia nervosa participants, and included them in the review. Two of the 10 trials included children. Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor. We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. The results suggest that treatment with psychological therapies does not reduce the risk of death from any cause. However, there is some evidence that psychological therapies may reduce the
This review included three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 516 participants. One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 151 adults to each receive either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas or sulfur
We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review. There was a low or positioner risk of composite maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women). Planned early delivery was associated with a low risk of HELLP syndrome, but there were no clear differences between subgroup analysis by gest
Six studies (including 142 participants) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two compared three-times-a-week prophylactic administratio with on-demand treatment in children with hemophilia A. Pooled results from these two studies showed a rate ratio of 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.76) for all bleeding and 0.22 for joint bleeds favouring preventive treatment. Three of the remaining four studies evaluated hem
We included 13 trials involving 1824 participants in this review. We were unable to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the difference between the interventions assessed in the studies. Inadequate reporting of study methodology was a common feature of the trials, preventing thorough assessment of study quality. In 10 trials (732 participants), data in usable format were only available in 10 trials. In total, 13 trials (1824 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review however, data in
Two studies involving 447 RhD negative women were included in this review. The studies compared IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis. In both studies the women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation. There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for mean comparison of this uncommon outcome. However, from two to three
This review included eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes. Five included studies investigated clopidogrel compared to aspirin or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, or to aspirin alone. Three studies investigated ticlopidine compared to placebo or placebo. All studies included patients with previous CVD except the CHARISMA trial which included patients who had multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. Overall the risk of bias of the trials was
Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a two-week intervention, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, and one evaluated three-week treatment sessions. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials evaluated a single treatment session, diet treatment, or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve (Condition changed and/or recovered) health in other ways. One trial evaluated two weeks of diet therapy
This update of the systematic review on nocturnal-NIPPV in COPD has led to the inclusion of three new studies, leading to seven included studies on 245 people. These included partial pressure of CO2 and O2 in arterial blood, six-minute walking distance (6MWD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure (
We included four randomised controlled trials, involving 1190 women, that compared induction of labour with expectant management for suspected macrosomia. There was no clear difference between the two interventions in terms of the risk of caesarean section (risk ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.09). There were no clear differences in the number of women who had a vaginal birth or in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care
We identified 159 randomised clinical trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 95,286 participants. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
This review found that fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine were effective in reducing weight in people with Parkinson's disease. However, these drugs were associated with gastrointestinal side effects, tremor, somnolence and sweating, and side effects were more common with fluoxitine. There was no clear evidence that any of the drugs were better than placebo in terms of reducing weight.
We found five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 734 participants. We assessed only one study as good quality and the other four as poor quality. No significant differences favoured VGB or CBZ in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation, but results did show a disadvantage for VGB on time to first seizure after randomisation. However, it was difficult to perform a meta-analysis by extracting aggregate
We found four randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that evaluated the effects of G-CSF plus plerixafor in people with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Two of these trials were closed prematurely due to low recruitment and did not report results. The remaining two trials evaluated 600 participants with multiple or non Hodgkin lymphomas. In both studies the experimental group received
We included 23 trials involving 1806 women, of whom 717 received cone therapy and 717 no treatment. Cones were better than no active treatment (rate ratio (RR) for failure to cure incontinence 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.84) and compared with no active therapy (RR 0.96, 95%, CI 0.73 to 0.99). Cones did not seem to cause more side effects than
Eleven trials with a total of 2246 AF patients (ranging from 14 to 712 by study) were included within the review. Studies included education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education interventions. We found small but positive effects of education on anxiety, depression, and TTR compared with usual care. However, the effect on TTR was uncertain. There was no evidence of a difference between education and usual care in terms of the number of patients
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared PGE2 with no treatment or with other prostaglandins. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found 70 trials (11,487 women) comparing different types of PGE 2 formulations. In this update, seven new trials (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare different formulations (gels versus tablets
This review of five trials, involving 247 infants, found that cot-nursing resulted in no significant difference in mean body temperature (MD 0.02 degrees C; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, four trials found that fewer infants were breast fed on discharge, though the one trial that reported on episodes of hyperthermia found this to be statistically more common in the cot nursing group. There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain.
We included three studies, involving 146 participants. The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06). One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment. One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group). The quality of the
We included three trials, involving 244 women. The prostaglandins used were PG E2 analogue (sulprostone) in 50 participants and PG E1 analogue (misoprostol) in 194 participants at a dose of 250 mcg and 800 mcg respectively. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias. Prostaglandin was not superior in reducing the rate of manual removal of placenta (average risk ratio 0.82; 95%
We included six studies involving 355 infants - two using face mask CPAP, two CNP, one nasal CPAP and one both CNP and endotracheal CPAP (for sicker babies). For this update, we included no new trials. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) is associated with lower risk of treatment failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0
We included six studies (157 participants) in this review. All included studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. The results of two studies indicated that foam dressings do not promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with basic wound contact dressings. Pooled data from two studies comparing foam and alginate dressing found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing when foam was compared with hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings (RR 2.
We identified three eligible trials that compared endoscopic intervention with surgical intervention and included a total of 111 participants: 55 in the endoscopic group and 56 in the surgical group. The evidence is current to May 2015. Two trials compared endoscopy with surgical interventions and included participants with moderate to severe pain, and the third trial compared surgical intervention with no intervention. Compared with the surgical intervention, endoscopic interventions had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief, both at middle/long-
Only one trial was identified for inclusion in this review. This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting. The wounds were sutured after the excision. Patients were randomised to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed (holding back to a later time for at least 48 hours before removal and resumption of normal bathing, n = 442).
We found only one randomised controlled trial comparing prednisone with no treatment in 35 eligible participants. The trial did not report side effects in detail, but one participant died, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment. Neuropathy Impairment Scale scores after 12 weeks improved in 12 of 19 participants (12 of 19 randomised participants) who received the drug compared with one participant who did not receive the drug. There was no difference between the two groups in
We included six studies including a total of 2100 participants in this review. The studies included people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma. We found four studies including 792 participants in the main efficacy analyses, and one study involving 95 participants separately. The evidence is current to May 2015. The results of the studies showed that people taking oral steroids reduced their asthma symptoms by an average of 2.5% compared to people taking placebo. The number of people
We found three studies that met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants. The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. Overall, based on'silver-level' evidence there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy improves functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity and aerobic capacity. None of the studies reported negative effects of exercise therapy. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for functional ability
We included 19 randomised controlled trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients), and one with ICU patients). The evidence suggests that currently available antibiotics significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.99). For outpatient patients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that antibiotics significantly reduce
We found nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 1414 participants. All studies were in primary prevention populations and had an unclear or high risk of bias, and no studies had an intervention duration greater than 16 weeks. We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain diets on total cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, per
This review included 28 studies with a total of 1896 participants. Eight studies were judged to be at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or
We found four studies that evaluated the effects of caregiver medication diaries and home-based nursing programmes. Two studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and two were non-randomised trials. The interventions had no effect on CD4 percentage or viral load. A second study showed that the intervention had fewer participants reporting no missed doses compared to the control group (85% vs. 92%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant (p=.002
This review found five studies (696 participants) that compared fenoprofen 200 mg with placebo (a pretend medicine) for the treatment of pain following third molar extraction, laparoscopy, minor day surgery and episiotomy. There were insufficient data to analyse other dose or active comparators, time to use of rescue medication, or numbers of participants needing rescue medication. There was no difference in pain relief over 4 to 6 hours with a single dose of f
This review included six randomised controlled trials. Four trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group (n = 857 women); two trials were small (less than 25 women per arm) and two had moderate to high risk of bias. The evidence is current to January 2015. The review found that PFMT may reduce the risk of prolapse in women having surgery for surgery and compared with no treatment. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk
Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears) were included in this review. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, 197 participants). No statistically significant difference was found between topical and non-quinolone antibiotic treatments at week one or three: pooled RR was 0
We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis). Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS correctly differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%) and a specificity of 74.
We included 10 studies, of which 5 were new to this update; all interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings. There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 people in the 1 psychological study. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD), and improvement in quality of life. We found no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on the
This review included 14 trials with a total of753 participants with osteoradionecrosis. There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage than non-surgical treatments. There were also moderate-quality evidence of a significantly improved chance of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.003,
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 2961 participants. Four studies focused on abdominal closure, two on caesarean section and two on hip replacement. On average, a surgeon that used sharp needles sustained one glove perforation in three operations. The use of blunt needles reduced the risk of glove perfations with a relative risk (RR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval
The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found no significant difference in the number of people who responded to treatment with triffluoperazine compared with low or low-perity antipsychotics. There was also no
We found nine eligible randomised controlled trials including 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slow rates of weight gain, and provide some evidence that responsive
Two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants were included in this review. One randomised trial with 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants who received 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) versus placebo (mean difference (MD 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.11, P < 0.001) and
We found two studies, with data from 503 dental practices, representing 821 dentists and 4771 patients. One study used a factorial design to investigate the impact of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of fissure sealants in permanent molar teeth (the 32 teeth assessed using the GRADE approach). The other study assessed the effect of the use of fluoride sealants on tooth decay. The evidence is current to May 2015. The two studies were
We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving over 17,000 women and their babies. These trials were generally at low risk of bias. One trial did not contribute data. Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials did not report data). There was no evidence that zinc supplementation reduced the risk
We found ten randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1656 participants. All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure and mycological cure and decrease the relapse rate at one month (low quality evidence). Probiotics also decreased the relapse rates at six months (moderate quality evidence) and at one year (
We included seven trials (involving 696 participants) in this update of the review. The included trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification, which enhances the applicability of evidence drawn from this review. Two trials were from Germany and Italy which are high-income countries, while four were from Iran, one from Malaysia and the fourth from Turkey, and the seventh trial was from the United States of America. The evidence is current
We identified a large number of studies of laser photocoagulation of diabetic retinopathy (n = 83) but only five of these studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in the UK and one study in Japan. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. The majority of participants in four of these trials were people who had already received laser treatment to treat their diabetic retina.
We included two trials involving 269 participants. Both trials were conducted in China and Italy. The participants were mostly men (67%); the mean age was 65 years. We judged both trials to be at high risk of bias. Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of death in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. There was no difference between CPAP and oxygen therapy in terms of length of stay in intensive care unit (
We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear to high risk of bias overall. A variety of different agents for providing analgesia were assessed in the trials, and a number of different methods to measure pain relief were used, and thus results could not be combined in meta-analysis. Three trials compared diazepam with an alternative agent (ketamine; vinydan-ether; "other" anaesthesic agent for the provision of analgesia) and
We included 15 studies with a total of 1048 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United States. The majority of participants were adults of both sexes with mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years. Five studies included yoga breathing alone, while the other studies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and meditation. Interventions lasted from two weeks to 54 months, for no more than six months in the majority of studies.
The review included 10 trials (249 participants) using different treatment regimens. Seven of the 10 trials assessed single agents, and 3 assessed combined agents. Many of the studies did not present adequate data for the report of the primary outcome of the review, which was the percentage change in muscle strength score at six months. Pooled data from two trials showed that combined agents may be more effective than single agents in improving muscle strength scores. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 3144 participants in this review. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical cure rate and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) than vancomycin in clinical infections due to MRSA, but there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the two antibiotics. There were no significant differences in all
We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 512 participants in this review. We found no significant differences in survival, postoperative mortality, and morbidity between the two groups, except for delayed gastric emptying, which significantly favoured CW. Furthermore, we noted that operating time (MD -45.22 minutes, 95% CI -74.67 to -15.78; P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss, and red blood cell transfusion were significantly
This systematic review of six randomised controlled trials involving 1862 participants found that calcium channel blockers may reduce the risk of death and disability in traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. However, the results of this review are limited by the small number of participants included in the studies and the low quality of the evidence.
We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 3090 participants. Three trials were considered to have a relatively low risk of bias, and one trial was considered to be of a relatively high risk. When survival to hospital discharge was compared, 38 of 320 participants survived to discharge in the initial CPR plus delayed defibrillation group compared with 39 of 338 participants (11.54%) in the immediate CPR group (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0
The evidence is current to May 2015. We found fifteen trials that compared GnRH antagonist therapy with conventional GnRH therapy. Three trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. Ten trials involving eight different comparisons of GnRH agonists have been included. The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional Gnrh antagonist protocol compared to stop protocol. Only one trial reported live birth rates. The total dose of gonadotrophins given was higher in the antagonist group.
This review includes 53 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2981 participants. Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.5 to 0.6, NNT 7 to 8), although some small but negative but negative studies might not have been identified by the search. Family interventions may also reduce hospital admission and encourage compliance with medication, although it does not obviously affect the tendency of individuals/
We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared paclitaxel with placebo or no treatment in 263 participants with symptomatic in-stent restenosis. All three trials were carried out in Germany and Austria. Two of the trials were industry sponsored. Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany) and the third company manufactured the stents.
This review of seven trials involving 922 participants found that corticosteroids reduced the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities and mortality in people with acute myocardial infarction. Corticosteroid treatment also reduced the duration of fever and C-reactive protein (CRP) to normalise (MD −1.65 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.31 to 0.46; 907 participants); 7 studies without resultant serious adverse events (
We included eight studies involving 846 randomised participants. Four studies involved comparisons of PIP with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction, parent guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy) and two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. The studies included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. The evidence is current to May 2015.
We found one new included study in this updated version of the review. In total, we included 11 trials (with 753 participants). The low quality of evidence showed that in comparison to room air, women in labour receiving supplementary oxygen had higher maternal oxygen saturation at one minute and at five minutes, maternal PaO2 (able to move from the airway to the baby's lungs) and lower maternal Apgar scores. None of the 11 trials reported maternal desaturation (bound to
We included twelve studies with a total of 2196 participants; four of these studies were newly included in this 2011 update of our 2006 Cochrane review. Six studies provided data on the percentage of pills taken in four studies. Reminder packaging increased the percentage (MD) 11% in two studies, and the number of pills (MD 11%) taken in three studies. The number of people who dropped out of the studies due to side effects was similar in the two studies that used reminder packaging
We identified 15 randomised trials evaluating 11 different pharmacological interventions (methylprednisolone, multivitamin antioxidant infusion, vitamin E infusion, amrinone, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, mannitol, trimetazidine, dextrose, allopurinol, and OKY 046). All trials had high risk of bias. There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or perioperative
We included 61 studies; 46 for prevalence, six for both prevalence and risk factors, and nine not meeting the inclusion criteria. The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the incidence of chronic kidney disease. The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies,
This review included two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan® and Ciklavit® were included. The single trial of Cajanus cajan reported a possible benefit to individuals with sickle cell disease (low-quality evidence). It did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia over a six-month period. No serious adverse effects were reported. The trial of Nicosan® did not
We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1999 participants. The studies were reported as RCTs; blinding was not reported, but given the study design it is likely that there was no blinding. One study was published in abstract form only; hence, detailed assessment of the risk of bias was not possible. Two trials compared standard treatment with standard treatment, diet therapy, radiotherapy,
We found 31 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared desogestrel with placebo (a fake pill) or other hormonal birth control pills. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills or injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. Seven of the 10 included trials had a low risk of bias. However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the RCTs were able to blind participants to treat their pain, pain, physical function and quality of life, while most of the trials reported blind outcome assessment of participant self reported. One
We found nine high-quality randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 260 participants. Six trials focussed on comparison of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy, whereas three trials compared two interventions that both met our definition. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials showed that exercise therapy improved muscle power function, exercise tolerance functions, exercise capacity and mobility-related activities in terms of muscle strength
We found only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) or delayed (hold back to a later time) (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) in this review. The trial had a high risk of bias. Information on the outcome mortality was available for 68 participants (28 people in the
We found 11 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. Seven of these trials provided evidence for the main comparison and the primary outcome and these were pooled. Overall, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of SSI with a 76% to a 0.26% relative reduction in SSI when compared with a single dose of antibiotics (472 participants). There is
We found one study, involving 40 infants and 42 women, that compared caesarean section for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks and 0 days gestation for fetal gastroschisis at 36 weeks' gestation for women who were at high risk of having a baby with this condition. There were no significant benefits or adverse effects of elective caesarea n section and neonatal survival. There was no difference between the two policies in the number of babies who survived
We found three studies in adults, lasting up to one week; 122 participants were randomised initially, and 95 completed treatment. All used paracetamol as an add-on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily morphine doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine daily). Other medications included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, or neuroleptics
This review of 15 randomised controlled trials found that astemizole and diphenhydramine were more effective than propantheline and doxepin for the treatment of colds in children and adults. However, the quality of the studies was poor and the results are vulnerable to considerable bias. More research is needed.
We included six randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 195 participants with MS. Two trials investigated inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device; three trials investigated expiratory muscle exercises, using a fixed-effect model for all but one outcome; and one trial, regular breathing exercises, reported no serious adverse events. Compared to no active control, meta-analysis of 5 trials (N=137) for both inspir
This review included one randomised controlled trial in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed. This trial found no statistically significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia (risk ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 2.05) and neonatal bleeding (RR 1.05, 95%. Review authors conducted an intention-to-treat analysis which showed similar findings: RR 1
We found two completed randomised controlled trials, with a total of 111 participants, that met our inclusion criteria. Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the trials. The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all participants, four DALK surgeries had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes
We included 67 randomised controlled trials (from 76 reports), recruiting 8506 women; the number of women included in analyses varied greatly between outcomes, with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women). Women receiving iron supplements were significantly less likely to be anaemic at the end of the intervention compared to women receiving control (risk ratio (RR) 1.85) and were less likely than women receiving no iron supplements to experience anaemia. The risk of anaemia was
This review included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,726 patients. The quality of evidence for overall survival and progression-free survival was very low. No reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in the combination arm, with a summary hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.53-0.87), however, this result may have been driven by findings from the single first-line treatment setting study. Longer progression
This review found that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on pulmonary function particularly in the early post-operative period and is less prone to rupture (wound dehiscence/incisional hernia). The data on pain is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a cross-sectional incision is less painful. There was no difference seen in other early or late complications and recovery times although the transverse incision was
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 981 participants in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. All included studies were judged as having high risk of performance bias and high risk for detection bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least
We included 18 trials reporting on 4843 participants comparing bisphosphonate administration to control regimen. The evidence is current to May 2015. There was no clear difference in the proportion of participants with pain response (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.43; P = 0.20; 3 trials; 876 participants); low quality evidence suggests that bisosphonates probably reduced the incidence of skeletal-related events in participants with prostate cancer metastatic to
We found five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 1093 patients. Four trials were conducted in previously untreated patients and one in relapsed patients. All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually patients are not blinded. The quality of the five trials evaluating stem cell transplantation is rated as moderate. Overall, the quality of evidence was limited by the small number
We included 15 randomised controlled trials (1437 participants) of WDD for schizophrenia in this review. The evidence is current to May 2015. When WDD was compared with antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine or risperidone, there was no difference in short-term global state of participants compared with placebo or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-
We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 799 participants. The review assessed six comparisons: 1. Multistrand stainless steel versus superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) arch wires; 2. NiTi versus non-stainless steel wires; 3. Multiistrand steel versus NiTi wires; 4. Non-sterile versus stainless steel
This review includes just one study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France. The study did not measure any of our primary or secondary outcomes but did measure behavioural change using three scales: the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; 12-item scale), and the Observation Scale (OS). The study was funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the
We included 13 trials with 1316 participants in a qualitative synthesis. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, secretions, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised. Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods, skin care procedures, and measurement tools. Nine trials were funded by the manufacturer of the skin care products used in the trials. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no evidence to support the use of
We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antiviral drugs in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacy
This review examined four trials involving 2250 people with type 2 diabetes who were randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Insulin was given once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily (twice-daily) in the remaining three studies. The studies lasted 24 to 52 weeks. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that insulin detenir was associated with
This review of six trials found that SNS is effective in reducing the frequency of episodes of faecal incontinence in people with severe FI. However, the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of trials included in the review and the small numbers of participants in the included trials. Further research is needed to determine the effects of SNS for people with FI.
This review included two trials (n = 190), at low risk of bias, and both presented data on first time failure at the tooth level. Pooling of the data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands, with a hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.80 to 4.41) (risk of event for molar tubes = 57%; risk of event in molar band = 25%). One trial (n
We found 66 articles (published between 1988 and 2012) that were eligible for inclusion in this review. We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who were staged with EUS. For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to the depth of invasion of the gastric wall. For metastatic tumour stage (M) the results were divided into two groups: one group had tumours that had spread to the lymph nodes and the other group
We identified six randomised controlled trials involving 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay surgery for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial varied between 40 and 47 years. The proportion of women in the laparoscopy group varied between 74% and 84%. The mean age in the trials ranged from 28 to 150. The duration of the studies ranged from one week to two years. We found
We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review. Two studies used a placebo control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin as an 'active' placebo to help maintain blinding. For postherpetic neuralgia, we found four studies (1272 participants). At both 8 and 12 weeks about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration caps
We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the data from all three trials using the primary electronic data and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the use of a lateral or transrectal approach to the surgical treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. We found only one trial that met our inclusion criteria. The participants underwent enterostomy placement in the frame of an operation for: rectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis,
We included 24 studies with 2126 participants in this review. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy. These included hospitalisation rates, clinical improvement in mental state, clinical improvements in mental health and clinical improvement of quality of life. The quality of the evidence was very low. There is a need for
We included 11 studies with 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain. Eight studies were double-blind, two single-blind and one open-label, and one both. None had a placebo only control; eight studies compared different NSAIDs, three an NSAID with opioid or opioid combination, three NSAIDs with opioid alone, one NSAID and one opioid combination. The studies lasted one week or longer, but fewer completed treatment or had results of treatment. None compared
This review included two studies involving 287 participants. One study (with an overall unclear to high risk of bias) involved 253 participants and the quality of the evidence for most outcomes was very low. This study reported that tinzaparin resulted in more rapid resolution of pain, as measured with a numerical pain scale, at day two and day three than in the placebo group and additionally at day 4 (P < 0.01, analysis of variance). This study also reported that pain severity
We found 36 observational studies (1285 patients) that compared antiplatelets with anticoagulants in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The evidence is current to May 2015. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of death or disability between the two groups. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627 patients) and major extracranial hemorrhages (7/425 patients) occurred only in the ant
We identified 26 randomised controlled trials (2066 patients) that compared silver nitrate with non-silver dressings. The evidence is current to May 2015. We grouped results according to wound type, and silver preparation. One trial showed fewer infections when silver nitrates were applied to wounds with silver sulphadiazine (SSD) cream compared to non-SSD dressings (in a variety of formulations - including SSD cream) when compared to SSD with non
We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination therapy 0.97, 95
We included 29 studies (12 were controlled studies investigating policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction). Participants were most often senior citizens or low income adult populations, or both, in publically subsidized or administered pharmaceutical benefit plans. Impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restrictions were implemented or relaxed. When policies targeted gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes, decrease drug use and substantial savings on drugs occurred immediately and for up to two years
Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review with data available for a total of 4232 participants. The included studies reported a wide variety of interventions. We summarised data by categorising similar interventions into comparison groups. Four studies compared any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA. Two studies reported the outcome measures and outcome measures. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis. The
This review included five small trials with a total of 49 participants. Two trials (30 and 49 participants) compared oral steroids with placebo or no treatment; one trial (28 participants) of oral or intra-articular steroids (40 participants) with a placebo; and one trial with 28 participants of oral steroids versus no treatment. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials were small and of low quality. The results of the trials suggest that oral steroids may be effective in
Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results of results. Moreover, the high rate of attrition further increased the risk of bias. All three trials compared rTMS with sham TMS. None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS symptoms of the participants. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of rT
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1049 participants. All studies involved different comparisons, none had a placebo group. In 1 trial, plasma exchange plus prednisone gave significantly better disease control at 1 month (0.3 mg/kg: RR 18.78, 95% CI 1.03 to 0.78). In the other trial, there was no difference between the
This review included a total of 75 randomised controlled trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicine preparations were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy. Herbal medicines were also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone. The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low. Compared with
We found 22 trials that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy. The trials included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs evaluated included levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in dose other than 0.5 mg (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, pregnancy
We included 15 studies with 561 patients in this review. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and female patients was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. Eight studies were assessed to be at high
We included 50 studies (45,285 participants): 47 studies (39,820 participants) compared statins with placebo or no treatment and three studies (5547 participants) with two different statin regimens in adults with CKD who were not yet on dialysis. We were able to combine the results of 38 studies (37,274 participants). The risk of bias in the included studies was high. Seven studies comparing statin with placebo had lower risk overall, and were
We found nine trials with 379 participants. Participants had cerebral palsy (CP) in five of the studies and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in the other four. Participants across the trials were followed up for at least six months. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of people who had a fracture in the first six months of follow-up. There was no evidence that there was a difference between the groups in the
We found seven randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1697 participants. Six trials were included in the quantitative analyses and six trials were excluded from the qualitative analyses. No data were available from the seventh trial. We judged five trials to be at high risk of bias due to selective outcome measures that can be measured, and four trials involving 1034 patients were considered to be of low quality. Three trials of safety and tolerability outcomes were included. The evidence is current to May
We included seven randomised controlled trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. The evidence is current to May 2015. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke in people with a history of stroke. We found that RIC may reduce the risk of stroke by up to 50% in people who have had a stroke. However, we did not find any evidence of a difference in the number of people who died from any cause. We
We included six randomised controlled trials, involving 204 preterm infants, in this review. Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk increased in-hospital rates of growth in weight (3.82 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.94 to 4.7; five RCTs, 101 infants; I² = 73%), length (triceps MD 0.06 cm/wk,95% CI 0.09 to 0.17;
The review includes 45 studies: 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies. Almost all the included studies (44/45) compared the effectiveness of PEM to no intervention. Only two studies reported patient outcomes. Based on seven studies and 54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.13 when PEMs were compared to no interventions (range from -0.16 to +0.11). Based on three studies and eight outcomes,
We found 23 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. Most were conducted in the USA and in health-care clinics. The majority of interventions provided information about STI and taught safer sex skills. A variety of STIs were addressed including HIV and chlamydia. None of the trials explicitly mentioned HPV or cervical cancer prevention. The interventions varied in duration, contact time, provider,
We included twenty studies with a total of 2337 participants in this review. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information of information. One study compared brief psychodynamic therapy with cognitive behavior therapy. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that brief psychoeducational interventions were less likely to be non-compliant with medication than those receiving routine care in the short term (n = 448, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI
We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations. Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'. The
We included three studies with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. All studies were conducted in emergency department settings in the USA (two studies) and Spain (one study). All studies compared heliox with 30% humidified oxygen. Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen for 20 minutes. There may be no difference in croup score, function, quality of life or lung function between the two groups. There were no serious adverse
We included eight studies in this review. The studies were conducted in primary (four), secondary (one) and tertiary care (three) settings. The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies. The risk of bias of studies was moderate with high risk of
Two randomised trials were identified. One trial compared the outcomes of surgical urethral dilatation and optical urethrotomy in 210 adult men with stricture disease. In the first six months of follow-up, men were more likely to require further surgery than in the primary urethroplasty group (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.62 to 7.07). After two years, the proportion of men being stricture free at three years
We included six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) for a total of seven group comparisons. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. The trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of patients dying from any cause between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had a serious adverse event (
We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with chronic kidney disease stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) assessed lifestyle advice with or without lifestyle advice, and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (
We found only one study (156 children aged between seven weeks and 24 months with signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis) that met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. Participants were randomised into three groups: nebulised salbutamol (in a mist in a tent or nebulisation saline group) and a mist and mist group. The results showed a significant decrease in respiratory distress symptom scores in the nebulising salbutamsol group but no
We identified four studies (1154 participants, age range 50 to 90 years). All participants had a diagnosis of probable or possible AD according to standard criteria and most participants were established on a cholinesterase inhibitor. The primary outcome in all studies was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). All studies provided change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) from baseline. When we pooled the data, there was no significant benefit from
Four studies involving 149 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies assessed the effect of night splinting in a total of 26 children and adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. One study assessed the efficacy of prednisone treatment in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo. The other two studies evaluated the effectiveness of night spint
This review of 25 randomised controlled trials (5218 women) found that women who were upright during labour were less likely to have a caesarean section and to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) than those who were in a recumbent position. The duration of labour was approximately one hour shorter for women randomised to upright positions and 22 minutes shorter for those women who received bed rest. There was no difference in the number of women
We found three randomized controlled trials, but only two of them had a follow-up of six months or more, which was the minimum required for inclusion in the review. The first trial compared natural progression with an active intervention. The second trial compared a natural progression intervention with a control group that did not receive any treatment. The third trial compared two different types of natural progression interventions. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who
Twenty-one trials involving 884 people were included in this review. A hand brace was found to improve symptoms after four weeks (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -2.28). In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial (not necessarily present in the service). However one trial showed significant symptom improvement after seven
We included two randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that enrolled a total of 708 participants with CRVO-ME. One trial compared triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal injections (n = 165) with observation injections. The other trial, GENEVA, compared dexamethasone implant with sham injections. In both trials, corticosteroids were given by injection into the eye.
Six randomised trials involving a total of 394 patients were included. Five of the six trials demonstrated a significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing nasal obstruction size. The first eight-week cross-over study showed that treatment with beclomethasone (336 mcg/day) yielded a greater improvement in mean symptom scores than placebo (-18.5 versus -8.5, P < 0.05)
We found one small randomised controlled trial (involving 24 women) conducted in Mexico. This study compared a control group who received antihypertensive therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, plasma expanders, corticosteroids and dypyridamole with an intervention group that received epidural block instead of the anthypertensives, as well as other antiepileptic drugs. There was no difference in the number of women who had a seizure
We found 16 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared glucocorticosteroids with placebo or no treatment. All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias. Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) provided data for analysis (927 participants received cortocosteroids and 934 participants received placebo. The average duration of the trials was 28 days. Glucocort
We included four trials involving 245 participants in the review. Study sample sizes were generally small, and interventions and outcome measures varied, and thus it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills, with a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due
We included eight studies with 582 participants in this review. Five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants contributed to the meta-analysis. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatments. The average age of study participants ranged from 65 to 73 years and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. The proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84
We found only one randomised controlled trial (13 participants) that assessed RBC transfusion strategies in people with MDS. The quality of the evidence was very low. The one included study randomised participants to a restrictive [haemoglobin (Hb) transfusion trigger < 72 g/L, 8 participants) or liberal policy (i.e. Hb trigger < 96 g/dL, 5 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine a difference in all-
We found two studies that evaluated the effectiveness of a game called 'Family Feud' to improve knowledge of infection control in children and adolescents. The first study was based on the television game show "The Family Feud" and focused on infection control. The study did not assess any patient or process of care outcomes. The second study evaluated the effects of the game on the knowledge test and found that children who played the game had statistically higher or position or degree of knowledge scores on
This review included eight trials involving 475 people with bipolar or unipolar disorder. Two of the studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or non-manic disorders, and the other two studies included people with both bipolar and unipolar disorders. The evidence is current to May 2014. The review found that lithium was more effective than antidepressants in reducing the number of people who had a relapse to hospital. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between lithium and antidepressant drugs
Two studies with 130 patients (67 and 63) randomised to intervention versus control were included. Both studies had a low risk of bias. Amifostine versus placebo showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of xerostomia (130 patients), the decrease of scintigraphically measured uptake of technetium-99m by salivary or submandibular glands at twelve months (80 patients, one study), one study, and the reduction
We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome. Two studies compared parent-mediated interventions versus TAU; the third compared a parent plus clinician-mediated intervention versus a clinician intervention alone. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over a period of 12 weeks. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of children who developed symptoms of Down syndrome
We included two trials from 1987 and 2004 with a total of 148 participants who had had heart valve surgery. Both trials had a high risk of bias. The trials did not report on health-related quality of life, and the secondary outcomes of New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction and cost. There was insufficient evidence at 3 to 6 months follow-up to judge the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to no exercise. We did find that, compared to
This review included five studies with 1130 participants. Two studies evaluated meditation, the others evaluated multi-disciplinary palliative care interventions that involved a chaplain or spiritual counsellor as a member of the intervention team. The studies evaluating meditation found no overall significant difference between those receiving meditation or usual care on quality of life or well-being. However, when meditation was combined with massage in the medium term, it buffered against a reduction in quality of the life of people
We found six trials with a total of 137 participants. We found two studies with 45 participants examining the effect of tDCS compared to sham tDCS. There was very low quality evidence for no effect on change in global UPDRS score (mean difference (MD) -7.10 %, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.18 to 4.97; P = 0.25, I² = 21%, random-effect model). However, there was evidence that
We included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (n = 32). They did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for pain intensity. One small study compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents. The quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency
We included 14 trials, including 2488 participants, in this review. Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. Incomplete recovery A combination of antivirals and corticosteroids alone may have little or no effect on rate of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to cortics alone. There was no difference in the number of people with incomplete recovery between the two groups. There were also no differences in the
We found two randomised controlled trials, including 97 women, that compared LHRH agonists with placebo in relapsed EOC in comparison with a chemotherapeutic agent (treosulfan or decapeptyl) or no treatment. There may be little or no difference between treatment with leuprorelin and placebo in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in women with platinum-resistant EOC. There was no difference in
We found 17 eligible randomised controlled trials that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten trials compared iNO versus control (placebo) or standard care without iNO in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (Ninos 1996; Roberts 1996; Wessel 1996; Davidson 1997; Ninos 1997; Mercier 1998; Christou 2000; Clark 2000; INNOVO 2007; Liu 2008). One trial (Mercier 1998) compared
We included seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. There is moderate-quality evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions for the treatment of low back pain. It is still unclear if lumbars are more effective
We included 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations in this review. Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18 to 70 years, including patients in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition. The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information. Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection
This review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas in Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrients or macronutrient supplementation (two studies), and
Twelve randomised controlled trials (1023 participants) were included in this review. Pooled data across five trials (418 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between foam dressings and hydrocolloid dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 to 16 weeks (risk ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.22). No statistically significant between-group differences in healing outcomes were detected when foam dressing were compared with: par
We found two randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. One study (n = 159) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) with placebo in patients with active IBD. The other study (N = 222) compared cele
We found 22 trials with a total of over 2310 participants. The included studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 317) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks). At baseline, six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected; one trial did not report number of participants. Six trials included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers, and one trial included both types of ulcers. The evidence is current to
We found six studies that involved 5193 participants. Analysis showed that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 13% (fixed-effect risk ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.94, six studies, low-quality evidence), but had no effect on lower specificity pneumonia case definition (i.e. confirmation by chest examination or chest radiograph) or prevalence of pneumonia defined by specific clinical criteria by 21%. On subgroup
Ten studies including 33,179 participants were included in this review. Eight studies found no significant effect of vitamin A on the incidence of acute or chronic LRTI, or prevalence of symptoms of acute LRTIs. Two studies reported that vitamin A caused an increase in cough and fever in one study; and increase in symptoms of cough and rapid breathing in two other studies. Three studies reported no differences and no protective effect on vitamin A. Vitamin A did not increase the risk of
Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Concomitant therapy varied from none to any other bronchodilator plus corticosteroid (oral and inhaled). The following outcomes were significantly different when compared to placebo: Forced expiratory volume in one second improved with treatment: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 100 ml; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.2 to 5.1, and WMD -2.2 mm H
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that involved a total of 439 children (oral immunotherapy 249; control intervention 190), aged 1 year to 18 years. Each study used a different oral immunotherapy protocol; none used sublingual immunotherapy. Three studies used placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that oral immun
We included four trials involving a total of 579 participants. Two studies reported data on mortality and none of them had considered death as a primary endpoint. No data on short term mortality were available. No evidence of a difference in the risk of long-term mortality between participants who received ILR and those who were managed conventionally at follow-up (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.30; participants = 255; studies = 2; very low quality
We found four small randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias. Participants were randomised to either aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydrocesles) or surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroesles). All studies reported on the results of the study. The
We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38;
We included 21 studies with 2658 participants. All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy. Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies, third-wave CBT, psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. Five studies compared psychological therapy to enhanced or structured care. We found no studies that included physical therapy. The average number of
We included 63 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling a total of 3027 participants in our review. We were able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thoracotomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP were 0.52 compared to not having epidural (OR 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants). Simlarly, evidence synthesis of 18 RCTs favoured regional
Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 participants were included in this review. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene, thiopental, topiramate, and olanzapine), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine), topiramine, antidepressant drugs (amitriptyline, fluoxetine
We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies. Three trials were cross-over and four were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one trial with 40 participants and one crossover RCT with 67 participants). Analyses of three RCTs that involved at least one test treatment and one control treatment, concurrent enrollment and follow-up of the test- and control
We included 30 studies (18,682 participants in total). Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective and 22 studies contributed the secondary objective. We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size. We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively. In a subgroup of three studies including children up to 18 years, the prevalence of severe fatigue ranged
We included 36 trials involving 6914 people. There was variation in the antibiotic use, patient characteristics and risk of RTIs and mortality in the control group. In trials comparing a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics, there was a significant reduction in both RTIs (number of studies = 16, odds ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.38) and total mortality (total mortality = 17, OR 0.75, 95%, CI 0
This review found five studies that investigated the effects of educational interventions for people with dementia. All of them investigated educational approaches. Four studies examined nursing home residents and one study examined residents in group dwelling units. Two studies offered consultation in addition and two other studies offered guidance for nursing staff in addition. Three studies included only one or two nursing homes per study. No studies in community settings were included. The studies revealed inconsistent results. One study in the nursing home setting documented an increase of
Four randomised controlled trials were included in the review (416 women). The trials compared glucocorticoid supplementation during IVF with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. Two of the studies had data in a form that we could not enter into analysis, so results include data from only two trials (310 women). For the outcome of live birth, data were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data only for data from 212 women. The
We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this review. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one trial compared high-dose and placebo-controlled trials (63 participants). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. The evidence is current to January 2018. The trials compared the effects of standard- and high-dose of rhGH on growth
We included 26 studies with 1,695 participants that reported on three comparisons: complete removal from exposure and reduced exposure compared to continued exposure, and complete removal compared to reduced exposure. In 18 studies, authors compared the removal of exposure to exposure to intermittent exposure with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that reducing the amount of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same
The review included six trials (n = 1758). All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (INFLA, acute or chronic, of the ESOPHAGUS cause). Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial that had a mean age of 73 years. The duration of the trials ranged from one week to six months. The trials were conducted in the USA,
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion groups. We found evidence in favour of social skills programme compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found evidence that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were low for social skills. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 225 participants randomised to one of three treatment groups: pegloticase infusion every two weeks (biweekly, monthly or every month) or placebo (dummy treatment). This was the pooled results from two RCTs (225 participants, 145 with tophi at baseline). The results from one study indicated that biweekly (every two weeks), monthly or once a month, infusions reduced tophi in
The review identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria. In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 infants), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.25; typical risk difference (RD)
Five trials compared no additional treatment with additional chemotherapy after hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy and found a significant survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) was 25; absolute risk reduction (RR) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.96). The overall risk of death from any cause was reduced by
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital health interventions, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or
Twenty-three trials involving 2467 people were included in this review. Comparing methadone versus any other pharmacological treatment, we observed no clinical difference between the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment, number of participants abstinent at follow-up, degree of discomfort for withdrawal, three studies, 386 participants RR 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.37); degree of pain for withdrawal (RR 0.98 (CI 0.
This review found nine studies (eight randomised controlled trials and one control treatment) involving 1109 participants. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects. The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. Adverse effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist withdrawal than withdrawal
We included fourteen studies that compared molindone with placebo or other typical antipsychotic drugs. The duration of the studies ranged from very short (10 days) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over three months. The strength of the evidence relating to this compound is limited, owing to small sample size, poor study design, limited outcomes and incomplete reporting. We found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness (doctors' 4 RCTs n=
We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments for melasma. They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide, as well as less conventional treatments including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite. The
Twelve randomised controlled trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review. All studies were a minimum of one year long. Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias. Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 years. 83% of participants were white and 40% were male. A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first
This review found that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second in COPD patients, although one major trial demonstrate a statistically significant difference. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or on the number of patients who died from any cause. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ICS for the treatment of
We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women) comparing 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I2 = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or
We included seven studies that compared high versus low levels of PEEP (2565 participants). In five of the studies (2417 participants), a comparison was made between high- and low-level PEEP with the same tidal volume in both groups, but in the remaining two studies (148 participants), the tidal volume was different between high and low levels. We found no evidence of differences in the risk of death or serious adverse events between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was
This review included 42 studies (11,399 patients) including 19 studies from the original review (2010), as well as 23 new studies. Fifteen studies were excluded from this review (nine retracted from publication due to concerns about integrity of data and six lacking individual creatinine data). Overall, there was a significant increase in the need for RRT in the HES treated individual patients compared to individual patients treated with HES. There was no significant difference between HES and H
We found nine studies that enrolled 682 participants. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale with no treatment and two made comparisons with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Compared to no treatment, Rheaum officinales had a positive effect on SCr (MD -87.49 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -139.25 to -35.72) and BUN (
We included 13 studies, representing data from 2745 individuals with dementia. We found no significant differences in the test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting, suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting. There was a statistically significant difference in the positive likelihood ratio (the number of people with a positive test result and the number with a negative test result) between the two groups. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of the IQC
We included three studies involving 91 participants. All three studies investigated various types and intensities of outpatient rehabilitation programmes following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in adults with chronic stroke. Rehabilitation programmes included: modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) compared with a neurodevelopmental therapy programme; task practice therapy with cyclic functional electrical stimulation (FES) only; and occupational, manual therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting compared with other types of immobilisation.
Four trials, recruiting 136 participants, were included in this review. Two trials compared lamivudine alone versus HBIg alone. A third trial compared combination treatment (lamivudines and HBIgs) with lamivudsine alone and after six months after transplantation. The fourth trial compared HBIG plus lamivudes with HBIGs alone. Randomisation was performed one week after the transplantation in one of the trials and from transplantation until randomisation,
This review included ten studies, involving 1019 participants who were followed between three months to 10 years (1060 randomised). All studies had a high risk of bias. Sulphonylurea did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone at three months and at 12 months (one study), but it did improve glycaemic control in people with type II diabetes mellitus. There was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of the studies due to side
We included 70 studies (44,958 participants) in the review, and 63 studies (42,784 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. The evidence is current to May 2015. We have reported pooled effects across delivery modes only for those analyses that were of particular interest to assess when effects were sustained beyond the immediate short term. Outcomes at four or more months post-intervention showed that there was no significant difference in alcohol-related problems at four
We found three trials with a total of 492 participants who had received 530 THA. One study (81 participants) compared the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restriction versus no provision. Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if the provision resulted in any difference in the number of people who experienced a hip injury. The other two studies (109 participants) did not report on any outcome. The third study did not provide any information on the number
This review found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared LNG-IUDs with expectant management. In two trials, there was a statistically significant reduction in the recurrence of painful periods in the LNG -IUD group compared with the control group (95 women). In the third trial, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of women with painful periods.
We included 24 studies, with the majority (20/24) giving concerns about risk of bias. The majority were conducted in laboratory settings, with adult participants (17/24), and used between-participants designs (19/24). Six studies investigated availability interventions, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less-healthy options. Most studies (4/6) manipulated snack food or drink, and none investigated alcohol or tobacco
This review found no randomized controlled trials of PEP for the treatment of HIV seroconversion in HIV-infected patients. Only one case-control study was included. HIV transmission was significantly associated with deep injury, procedures involving a needle placed in the source blood vessel (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0 to 41), visible blood on the device, and terminal illness in the patient. After controlling for these risk factors, PEP was associated with a significantly
The review found that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of behaviour therapy for the treatment of people with MS. Behaviour therapy has small positive effects on disability, disability, mood and catastrophising immediately post-treatment, but not on pain or mood, when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, but all except a small effect on mood had disappeared at follow-up. There is a need for more research in this area.
We found 15 national initiatives, including more than 260,000 people, that met the inclusion criteria. None of the initiatives were provided in low-middle-income or low-income countries. All initiatives except one used an uncontrolled pre-post study design to evaluate interventions rather than on pooled outcomes. Because of high levels of study heterogeneity (I2 > 90%), we focused on individual initiatives rather than pooled results. We found no clear evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on
We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met our inclusion criteria. All studies had a small number of participants, ranging from seven to 16 people per study and had a cross-over design. Amitriptyline (three studies), bromocriptine, clonidine, propranolol (one study), levodopa (Prolopa®) and tryptophan
We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of intervention given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acids (DHA)), gamma-linolenic acid, and antioxidants). All studies reported
The 33 eligible studies largely compared open questions with checklist-type questions or rating scales. Two included participant interview methods. A subset of six studies suggested that more severe, bothersome, or otherwise clinically relevant AEs were reported when an initial open enquiry was used, while some less severe, or clinically relevant relevant AE were only reported with a subsequent specific enquiry. However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating or debilitating AEs are more likely to be detected when an
We searched the medical literature up to May 2015 and found 15 studies that assessed the effectiveness of GTCS in preventing SUDEP in people with epilepsy. We found 10 further records by searching other resources (handsearching). We removed 211 duplicate records and screened 381 records (title and abstract) for inclusion in the review. We excluded 364 records based on the title and abstract and assessed 17 full-text articles. Five studies measured sensitivity of devices to detect SUDEP but did
This review included seven randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 208 participants. One study was of parallel design with the remaining six being cross-over in design; participant numbers ranged from 17 to 75. The duration of the studies varied between four days and two years. The total study intervention duration was four days to two years, and the duration of follow-up ranged from one month to two
Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses. Based on thirteen studies, all using a CBT approach, CBT was more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment, and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT. The overall quality of the evidence was very low. The
Twelve trials (1,856 women) met the inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted in India, Jordan, UK and USA. Eight of the included trials compared progestogen treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared treatment with no treatment. In five trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials, women had suffered two or more miscarriages. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. The
In total, we included 14 studies with 1298 participants. Nine studies (704 participants) compared CM vs. control, and five studies (594 participants) combined CM and MIB interventions. We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions. For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately control for bias within their studies as such information was not often reported. The included studies rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes. For studies that did measure such
We identified 31 studies (44 reports) including 27,071 participants and two ongoing studies. The risk of bias in the studies was low or unclear for several domains. Compared to the transfemoral approach, the transradial approach reduced short-term net adverse clinical events (NACE) (i.e. adverse events assessed during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up) but did not reduce the risk of long-term NACE. However, short-
We found two studies of palliative care for people with advanced dementia. One study (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a team of people working together for people who had advanced dementia, and the other study (48 participants) compared a group of people who were not part of the team to those who were. Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure the same
This review of three randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between the various methods of sequencing in terms of survival, overall survival, relapse-free survival and metastasis free survival based on 1166 randomised women in three trials. However, concurrent chemoradiation increased anaemia, telangiectasia, and pigmentation in women with locally advanced breast cancer. There was no significant difference in the number of women who died from any cause. There were no differences in
We found nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving a total of 622 participants. The trials were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals. Three trials compared CrP plus resistance or weight training with placebo and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose. However, the other three trials compared the same dose of CrP alone versus placebo. The evidence is current to May 2015.
Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in a wide range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies were small and some did not present data that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparation preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effect for these treatments. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons.
We included five randomised controlled trials with total of 1049 women evaluating five different techniques modifications during either amniocentesis (three studies) or CVS (two studies). Three interventions were evaluated - intramuscular progesterone, hexoprenaline and selecting high or low puncture sites for late 'blind' procedure - each intervention in a single small study. There was no conclusive evidence of benefit for any of them. The same applies for terbutaline tocoly
We included 10 studies: four provided data for quantitative analyses (437 participants); five studies were randomised trials (1181 participants), three studies were non-RCTs (8037 live births); two studies were interrupted time series (ITS) studies (1 study of 2,242,438, 1 study unreported). Six studies were conducted in upper-middle-income countries (China, Mexico, South Africa, one study was conducted in a lower-income country (Bangl
We found six trials involving a total of 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow up of 17 years. Two trials compared screened infants with control infants (control infants who were not screened for CF) and one trial compared screened and control infants. Compared with screened infants, the odds ratio of weight below the tenth percentile was 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38) and for height was 4,62 (95
We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with a lower systolic blood pressure or'standard' blood pressure target in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHG, P < 0.
This review found 14 studies with a total of709 participants that compared non-removable casts with removable pressure-relieving devices. In five of those studies (366 participants) the number of ulcers healed was significantly more with non-reovable casts than with dressings alone. In one study (98 participants) there was a statistically significant increase in ulcers in the heel tendon lengthening group compared with the removable device group. There was no difference between the two groups in
This review identified five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared computer-assisted cognitive training (CAT) with physical activity training (physical activity training) for breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias, which means that the results may be influenced by chance. Two trials (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training (N = 95), one of meditation
We found 12 records referring to six randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared chlorpromazine with piperacetazine. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. The overall methodology and data from the included trials was poor. Only short-term data were available, from which conclusions could be drawn. We found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated
Five randomised trials were identified with a total of 207 participants, 102 to colorectal stenting and 105 to emergency surgery. The average time of clinical relief of obstruction was 0.66 day in the colonic stent group and was 3.55 days in the emergency surgery group. The stent insertion was successful in 86.02% of attempted stent placements. The 30 day mortality rate was similar, 2.3% in both groups. There was no
We included nine randomised controlled trials (1867 women) comparing human albumin or HES (two RCTs) versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of OHSS. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality for all comparisons. The main limitations were imprecision, poor reporting of study methods, and failure to blind participants. There was evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, though heterogeneity was substantial (Peto OR 0.67 95
Ten studies involving 484 patients were included. The evidence did not suggest an increase in patient satisfaction with any one agent versus another, but there was evidence that patients were less satisfied with placebo. There was some evidence suggesting that polidocanol (POL) was more likely to cause adverse reactions at a concentration of 1% compared with lower concentration or hypertonic saline, and that sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) and sclerosing agents were less likely to
We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Most of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol (primarily used as a bronchodilator) and
This review included 29 studies, enrolling 4216 participants. The studies compared antimicrobial lock solutions to standard sealing solutions of the CVC for HD. Antibiotic lock solutions were compared with non-antibiotic antimicrobial locking solutions, and 4 studies compared both antimicrobial and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) lock solutions. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that there was no difference in the number of people who died from any
We identified 15 eligible studies (1098 participants). Of these, six investigated pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or treatment of CMV when disease occurred, eight looked at antiviral treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis, and one reported on oral versus intravenous treatment. All studies were considered to be at low risk of attrition. Assessment of risk of bias identified that the processes reported for sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low or very low risk in only five and
We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that investigated the effects of sweet potato preparation on glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The studies lasted from six weeks to five months. All three studies were performed by the same trialist. There was a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at three to five
We included 19 studies with 440 participants. The average age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 22.33 years). Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor. In 13 studies, follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long-term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years
We included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol. The evidence is current to January 2015. The low quality of the evidence showed that there was an increased ongoing pregnancy rate in two trials including 426 women. For ongoing pregnancy rates, there were 127 ongoing pregnancies in the two trials compared to the standard protocol (pooled odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence
In five studies, recruiting a total of 694 infants, a long IT was associated with a significant increase in air leak and an increase in mortality before hospital discharge that reached borderline statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD and no studies examined the effects of IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons such as meconium aspiration and congenital heart disease (lungs with normal compliance). Caution should be exercised in applying these results to modern
We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients. The studies were of low methodological quality. There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed, including the health professionals who undertook the procedure, frequency, structure, duration, duration and number of patients. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence about the effects of TFU. Although some studies find that the intervention had favourable effects for some outcomes, overall the studies show clinically-equivalent results between TFU and control groups.
We identified 38 eligible retention trials. These trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentive schemes, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaire (e.g. with or without medical test kits). For four trials, there was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of the number of people who completed the questionnaire.
We included eight studies that involved a total of 829 participants (416 and 413 participants in the pLMA and cLMA groups, respectively). We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published; and data related to the first treatment period for the other five studies were not yet available. Seven included studies provided data related only to the primary outcome, and eight studies provided information related to more than one secondary outcome. No studies
We included 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1453 participants from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Fourteen trials recruited only children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only girls. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. The
We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised controlled trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Seventeen of the studies had student populations. The studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found no evidence of an effect on the number of children who dropped out of school due to any reason. We did
We included 85 studies in our synthesis. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income and 15 low-income ones. Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies looked at the experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context; service design and provision
This review of 16 trials, involving 3361 patients, found that calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk (RR) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92; the corresponding number of patients needed to treat was 19). For oral nimodipine alone, the RR was 19; for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of nimmodipine the results were not statistically significant. For
We identified three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared myeloablative therapy with conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment. The trials included 739 children. The average age of the children in the trials was one year. All three trials used an age of one year as the cut-off point for pre-treatment risk stratification. There was a significant statistical difference in survival in favour of myelo
We identified eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months). TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all-
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared increased versus standard energy intake in infants with CLD/BPD. Fourteen studies that appeared to be relevant were excluded. However, two excluded trials provided some insights into the topic. One study showed that infants who were fed formula enriched with protein and minerals had improved growth parameters up until the cessation of the intervention at three months of corrected age.
We found 13 studies enrolling 2341 participants (2360 procedures) involving 2360 procedures. The quality of evidence was very low or low for most outcomes, moderate for one outcome (femoral vein) and high at best for two outcomes (subclavian vein N = 1, femoral vein = 1). Most of the trials had unclear risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. The main results of this review are that femoral veins are
Fifteen studies were included using four different methods of administration of physostigmine (rapidly absorbed through membranes). Four studies, 29 people, used intravenous infusion; seven, 131 people used a conventional oral form, and one study of 181 people used verum skin patch. Intravenous infusion  There are no usable results from the IV infusion trial. Oral form  The few results available from the oral form trial suggest that there may be little or no difference in the
We included 13 trials involving a total of 16,112 participants. Eleven trials recruited participants with a history of coronary heart disease, two trials with a mix of people with CVD, and one trial with participants with history of stroke. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trials compared different doses of beta-blockers with placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of people who died or had a stroke between the groups.
Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention. Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective reporting and
We identified 12 studies (2494 participants) comparing amantadine with placebo, paracetamol, or zanamivir to treat influenza A in children (773 participants) and elderly (545 elderly) who had been exposed to influenza A during the previous three to 10 days. The evidence is current to January 2018. We found no evidence to support the use of any antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza A among children or elderly. The quality of the evidence
Nine studies, which included a total of 1512 women, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. Most of these studies included women with unexplained infertility. In seven studies the women were undergoing IUI and in two studies they were trying to conceive from sexual intercourse. Eight studies compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with no injury/placebo procedure; of these two trials, one trial also compared the two types of surgery. The evidence is
We included four studies (3905 participants), all of which were at high risk of bias. The studies all evaluated one comparison: professional oral care versus usual oral care. We did not pool the results from one study (N = 834 participants), which was stopped at interim analysis due to lack of a clear difference between groups. We were unable to determine whether professional oral hygiene resulted in a lower incidence of NHAP compared with usual oral hygiene over an 18-month period (hazard ratio
We found five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared bismuth subsalicylate versus placebo, budesonide, mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate. These studies included a total of 149 participants. The studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (receiving information from participants about the
Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients. Intervention duration ranged from 6 months to 12 months. Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care, one trial compared SMUG with SMBG, and one trial (26 weeks to 52 weeks) compared the use of SMBG versus usual care alone. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of patients included in the studies, the
Eleven studies involving 471 participants met the inclusion criteria, although data were available from only five studies involving 276 participants with AsPD. Eleven different psychological interventions were examined, but only two studies focused solely on an AsPD sample. Compared to the control condition, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) plus standard maintenance was superior for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study, but CBT was not superior to standard maintenance alone. Only two studies reported on reconviction, and only
This updated review included 11 studies with a total of 1047 participants. Six studies contributed to one or more analyses related to the common cold, with up to 1047 people. One study contributed only to data on adverse events and one met the inclusion criteria but reported only summary statistics without providing any numerical data that could be included in the meta-analyses. There was a moderate risk of bias because of unreported methods. A wide range of antibiotics were used and outcomes were measured
We included five randomised controlled trials (162 randomised participants; three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department; one study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company). Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild to 23.7) in four studies.
We identified 12 randomised controlled trials enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group. Eleven trials tested vitamin D₃; five trials; 417 participants; very low-quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument; and one trial; 382 participants; moderate- quality evidence. Vitamin D had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow-up (rate -0
We included 62 studies with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release preparations (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR) preparations. The primary outcome for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief. We found no evidence that MIR preparations were more effective than
This review included 14 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1260 participants. The age of participants included in the studies ranged from 16 to 88 years; and the majority of participants were women (approximately 70%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure ranged from eight weeks to 23 months. The studies reported nine types of comparison:
Three randomised controlled trials, with 931 participants, tested different neoadjuvant treatments: RT alone; sequential RT and procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy; PCV chemotherapy alone; and temozolomide chemotherapy alone. None of the studies blinded participants or personnel, and, therefore, are considered at high risk of performance and detection bias. One study, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer of Cancer (EORT
We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA. All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months. Three trials (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast versus placebo; and one RCT compared oral metoclopramide versus placebo.
Three randomised controlled trials and three controlled clinical trials (including 1291 children) investigated the prevention of VTE (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) n = 134, antithrombin (AT) supplementation n = 37, low-dose warfarin n = 31, cryoprecipitate and/or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) supplementation and LMWH n = 41). Of the six included RCTs/CCTs, five investigated
Three trials with 287 participants operate on for Type I or II TAAA were included. In the first trial of 98 participants, neurological deficit in the lower extremities occurred in 14 (30%) of CSFD group and 17 (33%) controls. The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%). CSFD did not have a significant benefit in preventing ischaemic injury to the spinal cord. The
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 662 participants. Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant-rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate. In one trial of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP,
Twenty one eligible studies were identified with a total of 1525 participants. About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. One small trial showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone for failing to achieve full continence. The other trials showed that exercises plus electrical stimulation were better than exercises alone for improving continence and for reducing the frequency of urinary incontinence. One trial found no difference between electrical stimulation plus bio
This review found that using a urinary catheter after surgery does not reduce the risk of urinary tract infection. However, it does increase the risk that a catheter is re-inserted after surgery. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of urinary catheters after surgery to prevent urinary tract infections.
Ten studies (3340 participants) were included in the review. Seven studies compared aripiprazole monotherapy versus placebo (2239 participants); two of these included a third comparison arm—one study used lithium (485 participants) and the other used haloperidol (480 participants). Two studies compared an additional treatment to valproate or lithium (754 participants), and one study compared an adjunctive treatment (intended to offer an additional medication to placebo) to val
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared urokinase lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotics (n = 56 participants) versus systemic antibiotic alone, and one CCT (clinical trial where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing urokainase lock with systemic antibiotics alone. No RCTs or CCTs evaluating antibiotic lock treatment were identified. All studies had methodological limitations and clinical heterogeneity between studies
This review of 15 randomised controlled trials found moderate quality evidence that an educational video of advice focusing on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain when compared with no treatment at intermediate-term but not long-term follow-up. There is low quality evidence (one trial, 102 participants) that a video of instruction focusing on pain-related education was more effective than no treatment in reducing pain at the end of treatment. There was no difference in the number of
We found 49 studies and pieces of literature meeting the same population, intervention and outcome criteria as the Cochrane review, but identified from the broader literature providing evidence on policy implementation and consumer experiences. In total, 49 studies were included and formed the basis of a thematic synthesis, and which is presented in appendices to this review. No studies meeting the study design criteria were identified for inclusion in the review. The results of this review indicate that ideally communication between healthcare providers and consumers
We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group. The proportion of patients who were drug responders was also greater in the opioid group. However, the number of patients with side effects was higher in the opioids group. There was no difference in
Fifteen trials, involving 1022 adults with dorsally displaced and potentially unstable distal radial fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation especially in terms of patient characteristics and interventions. There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result. External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment): 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk (a measure of the
We found five studies (1127 patients) that compared early stent removal (removal of the stent at the beginning of the procedure) with late stent (removed at the end of the operation) removal. It is uncertain whether early removal of stents improves the incidence of urinary tract infections (MUCs) or improves the risk of death from any cause. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that early removal was associated with a reduction in
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons of crowns versus fillings. Four studies compared crowns (a prefabricated device made of plastic or austenitic alloys containing 75 percent or greater gold and metal) with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations; and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique (a method of treating tooth decay using a combination of mechanical and electrical techniques). One of these studies included a third arm
We included 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) in this review. Most studies were cross-over in design; 18 studies involved 296 participants. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece were used. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage, oral oscillating P
Four studies involving 1485 participants with moderate to severe CD met the inclusion criteria and were used in the meta-analyses. All studies included active CD patients with CDAI ranging from 220 to 450. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age. One study was identified as high risk of bias due to a non-identical placebo while the other studies were judged to be at low risk. CZP (100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks) was shown to
We searched the medical literature up to May 2015 and found 112 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the general population and included people with CKD. The average age of people in the studies ranged from 16 to 2916 years, and the average duration of follow-up ranged from three months to five years. We included 31 studies (23,762 participants) with data on CKD patients, however, data for this subgroup were not provided. The
Three studies involving a total of 1945 women were included in this review. No serious complications were reported in the trials and no neonatal or maternal deaths occurred. Overall, risk of bias across the three trials was mixed. The neonatal outcome was not statistically different between groups: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three studies, 1945 women); umbilical artery pH less than 7.16 (one study, 239 women); admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
We included two randomised controlled trials involving 54 participants with CVI. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control group and the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction (amount of blood pumped out of the left low chamber of the heart with each heart beat) compared
Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 were identified. Follow-up period varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo, ten trials of saline or arthrocentesis, and one trial of laser treatment. The evidence is current to
We found 10 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 4052 participants that met our inclusion criteria. Four trials (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics. The trials did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to
We found six randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that evaluated the effects of cysteine supplementation in preterm infants. The majority of patients in these trials were preterm. One large multicenter RCT evaluated short-term N-acetylcysteine-containing PN supplementation in extremely low birth weight infants (≤ 1000 grams). Growth was not significantly affected by the supplementation or by N-
We identified 77 trials including 6287 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. Forty-one trials (3829 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Thirty-five trials (35 trials) were at low risk of bias in all domains. All other trials were at high risk. Overall, all the evidence was very low quality. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of people who died from any cause between the two groups in terms of
In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430 participants converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years. The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases). The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity
We found three studies involving 170 participants. All included participants were male and were undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III. We found evidence showing no clinical differences in postoperative pain between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at one
We included 7 new observational studies in this update, bringing the total number to 14, including 5 cohort and 9 case-control studies, with 1,601,515 study subjects. Most studies found no causal association between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids (any steroid of any potency) and pregnancy outcomes when compared with no exposure. These outcomes included: mode of delivery (drugs given by injection into a vein or through a vein into the vagina), pregnancy outcomes, congen
We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was a pilot study that was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a trial of the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial, and the other two trials were trials of the steroid
We included four trials with 450 participants. The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). At the end of follow-up, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92). There was no difference
We found one trial, involving 120 families and 143 children, that compared centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home, improved or worsened child's cognitive ability, or both), with no treatment. The evidence is current to May 2015. The trial was small and of high risk of bias, as 63% of control group participants accessed day care services separate from those offered within the intervention. No evidence suggested that centre- based day care improved children's cognitive
In total, 126 reports describing 30 scoring indices were identified through the screening process. Eleven of these indices have undergone some form of index validation. The Nancy Index and the Robarts Histopathology Index have undergone the most validation in that four operating properties including reliability, content validity, construct validity and criterion validity have been tested. However, none of the currently available histologic scoring indices have been fully validated. Six of the included scoring indices explored content validity. Two of them were tested for responsiveness
We found three randomised controlled trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male. The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years. There were no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at risk of selection bias, detection and attrition. The evidence is current to
We included 11 studies involving 38,742 participants. Eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants). The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies. We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I2 statistic for subgroup differences
This review found that B-sitosterols improved urinary symptom scores and flow measures in men with myelodysplastic syndrome. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of men who had to use a urinary catheter, but there was some evidence of improvement in the amount of urine that passed through the urine stream. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. More research is needed.
The review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing with salbutamol. These included 62,815 participants with asthma (including 2,599 children). In six trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse events could be obtained. All-cause mortality was higher with regular salmetol than with placebo but the increase was not significant. Non-fatal serious adverse event were significantly increased when regular Salmeterol was compared with placebo. One
Two studies enrolled preterm infants with respiratory distress. Both studies had methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation and substantial post allocation losses. Neither study reported any significant benefits in neonatal morbidity or mortality from use of thyroid hormone for two days or no treatment. Meta-analysis of two studies (80 infants) found no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between infants treated with L-thyroxine 50 μg/dose at 1 and at 24 hours and no treatment
We included 38 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1828 participants. Eight RCTs had a low risk of bias in the assessment of mortality, and in the remaining outcomes. Random-effect meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention on mortality when including all RCTS with extractable data (1487 participants; moderate quality evidence). When including only the eight trials with a low
In this 2019 update, 65 studies (involving 3598 participants) were eligible; 45 studies contributed data to our meta-analyses (2698 participants). Treatments included bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds, teriparatide, denosumab, cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, and calcitonin. Median duration of follow-up was 12 months. Bone density or bone-related biomarkers (measured by bone-
We found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 people. Three trials studied oral magnesium, with doses ranging from 12.5 mmol/day to 20 mmol daily. One trial studied parenteral magnesium (16.24 mEq q6h for 24 hours). Only one trial looked at the effects of magnesium supplementation in people with acute myocardial infarction. There was significant clinical and methodological variation between the trials, and each trial demonstrated a high risk of bias
We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants in this review. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured with antibiotics than without antibiotics. There was no difference in the number of people who had a serious adverse events between the two groups. We found no evidence of a difference between antibiotics and placebo in terms of quality of life. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and
This review found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2515 patients that compared D3 with D2 lymphadenectomy. Three RCTs (all performed in Asian countries) compared the two types of lymph node dissection: data suggested no significant difference in OS between these two groups of lymph nodes dissection, with no significant differences in postoperative mortality and for no trial were DSS data available. Data for DFS were available only from one trial.
Thirteen studies, 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatment, no statistically significant difference were noted for all the primary outcomes. Considering only studies were patients were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference was found for retention and abstinence, but results come only from two studies considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favour of the drug is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26
We found two studies that examined the effects of dietary modification to fluid. Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. The first study was funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and the second by a pharmaceutical company. Both studies were conducted in the USA and involved people with and without dementia. Participants in the first study were followed up for at least six months after the
Six randomised controlled trials with a total of 788 women were included. The largest of these trials included 396 women eligible for this review. No evidence of a statistically significant difference was found between natural cycle and standard IVF in live birth rates. The evidence suggests that for a woman with a 53% chance of live birth using standard fertility treatment, the chance using natural cycle would be between 0.68 and 1.01. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We included a total of 984 participants from 12 studies (23 references) in this review. We included only those involved in Tai Chi and the control group (i.e. 811 participants) in the final analysis. Study sample size ranged from 10 to 206, and mean age ranged from 61 to 74 years. Programmes lasted for six weeks to one year. All included studies were RCTs; three studies used allocation concealment, six reported blinded outcome assessors
We included 72 randomised controlled trials that involved 2470 participants in this review. The evidence is current to May 2015. The studies were generally small and the interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the types of virtual reality devices used. This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the 35 studies included in the previous version of this review, which included 35 new trials in this updated version of the review. We found that the evidence is mostly of low quality.
We identified five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1330 participants. None of the included trials examined regimens of less than six months duration. Fluoroquinolones added to standard regimens A single trial (174 participants) added levofloxacin to the standard first-line regimen. The trial did not report on death, sputum conversion, and adverse events
