Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within a symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent, for example, in extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.The term was first used in the mid-1980s and refers to two different but related styles:

the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal;
a later, more widespread and popular style based in Europe with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.
