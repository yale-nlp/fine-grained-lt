Kapellmeister ( kə-PEL-my-stər, US also  kah-, German: [kaˈpɛlˌmaɪstɐ] (listen)) from German Kapelle (chapel) and Meister (master), literally "master of the chapel choir" designates the leader of an ensemble of musicians. Originally used to refer to somebody in charge of music in a chapel, the term has evolved considerably in its meaning and is today used for denoting the leader of a musical ensemble, often smaller ones used for TV, radio, and theatres.
