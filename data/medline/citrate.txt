A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in the kidney from substances in the urine. It may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Most kidney stones pass out of the body without help from a doctor. But sometimes a stone will not go away. It may get stuck in the urinary tract, block the flow of urine and cause great pain. The following may be signs of kidney stones that need a doctor's help:	Extreme pain in your back or side that will not go away	Blood in your urine	Fever and chills	Vomiting	Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy	A burning feeling when you urinateYour doctor will diagnose a kidney stone with urine, blood, and imaging tests.If you have a stone that won't pass on its own, you may need treatment. It can be done with shock waves; with a scope inserted through the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra; or with surgery.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
