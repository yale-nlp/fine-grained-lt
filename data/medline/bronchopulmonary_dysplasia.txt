When you breathe in, the air travels down through your trachea (windpipe). It then goes through two tubes to your lungs. These tubes are your bronchi. Bronchial disorders can make it hard for you to breathe.The most common problem with the bronchi is bronchitis, an inflammation of the tubes. It can be acute or chronic. Other problems include:Bronchiectasis - a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarredExercise-induced bronchospasm - a breathing problem that happens when your airways shrink while you are exercisingBronchiolitis - an inflammation of the small airways that branch off from the bronchiBronchopulmonary dysplasia - a chronic lung condition in infants, most often premature infants
