During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effortFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies.
