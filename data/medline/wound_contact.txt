MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  It causes a staph infection (pronounced "staff infection") that is resistant to several common antibiotics. There are two types of infection. Hospital-associated MRSA happens to people in health care settings. Community-associated MRSA happens to people who have close skin-to-skin contact with others, such as athletes involved in football and wrestling.Infection control is key to stopping MRSA in hospitals. To prevent community-associated MRSA:Practice good hygieneKeep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healedAvoid contact with other people's wounds or bandagesAvoid sharing personal items, such as towels, washcloths, razors, or clothesWash soiled sheets, towels, and clothes in hot water with bleach and dry in a hot dryerIf a wound appears to be infected, see a health care provider. Treatments may include draining the infection and antibiotics.
