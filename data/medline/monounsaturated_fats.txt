Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.But not all fats are the same. You should try to avoid:Saturated fats such as butter, solid shortening, and lardTrans fats. These are found in vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods, and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs). By 2018, most U.S. companies will not be allowed to add PHOs to food.Try to replace them with oils such as canola, olive, safflower, sesame, or sunflower.
