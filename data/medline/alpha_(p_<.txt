Cirrhosis can lead to  :Easy bruising or bleeding, or nosebleedsSwelling of the abdomen or legs Extra sensitivity to medicinesHigh blood pressure in the vein entering the liverEnlarged veins called varices in the esophagus and stomach.

In the United States, the most common causes are chronic alcoholism and hepatitis. Nothing will make the scar tissue disappear, but treating the cause can keep it from getting worse. If too much scar tissue forms, you may need to consider a liver transplant.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
