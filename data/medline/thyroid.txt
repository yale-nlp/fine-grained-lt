Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods.Thyroid diseases cause your thyroid to make either too much or too little of the hormones. Some of the different thyroid diseases include:Goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid glandHyperthyroidism, which happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needsHypothyroidism, which happens when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormonesThyroid cancerThyroid nodules, lumps in the thyroid glandThyroiditis, swelling of the thyroidTo diagnose thyroid diseases, your health care provider may use a medical history, physical exam, and thyroid tests. In some cases, your provider may also do a biopsy.Treatment depends on the problem, how severe it is, and what your symptoms are. Possible treatments may include medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery.Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health
