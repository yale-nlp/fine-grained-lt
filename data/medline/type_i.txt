Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too 
high.  With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that 
helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose 
stays in your blood.  Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your 
heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any 
age. Symptoms may include:	Being very thirsty 	Urinating often 	Feeling very hungry or tired 	Losing weight without trying 	Having sores that heal slowly 	Having dry, itchy skin 	Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet 	Having blurry eyesight A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do, you will need to take insulin for 
the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
