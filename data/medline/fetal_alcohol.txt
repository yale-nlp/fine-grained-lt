Alcohol can harm your baby at any stage during a pregnancy. That includes the earliest stages, before you even know you are pregnant. Drinking during pregnancy can cause a group of conditions called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Children who are born with FASD can have a mix of problems, such as medical, behavioral, educational, and social problems. The kinds of problems they have depend on which type of FASD they have. The problems could include :Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lipSmall head sizeShorter-than-average heightLow body weightPoor coordinationHyperactive behaviorDifficulty with attention and memoryLearning disabilities and difficulty in schoolSpeech and language delaysIntellectual disability or low IQPoor reasoning and judgment skillsSleep and sucking problems as a babyVision or hearing problemsProblems with the heart, kidneys, or bonesFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most serious type of FASD. People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities, including wide-set and narrow eyes, growth problems and nervous system abnormalities.Diagnosing FASD can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood test, for it. The health care provider will make a diagnosis by looking at the child's signs and symptoms and asking whether the mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms, medical care for health problems, behavior and education therapy, and parent training. A good treatment plan is specific to the child's problems. It should include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes when needed.Certain "protective factors" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help people who have them reach their full potential. They include:Diagnosis before 6 years of ageLoving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school yearsAbsence of violence around themInvolvement in special education and social servicesThere is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. To prevent FASDs, you should not drink alcohol while you are pregnant, or when you might get pregnant.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
