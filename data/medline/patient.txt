You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact, you may have charts at several doctors' offices.  If you've been in the hospital, you have a chart there, too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information, it's a good idea to keep your own personal health record.  What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start with:	Your name, birth date, blood type, and emergency contact information	Date of last physical	Dates and results of tests and screenings	Major illnesses and surgeries, with dates	A list of your medicines and supplements, the dosages, and how long you've taken them	Any allergies	Any chronic diseases	Any history of illnesses in your family
