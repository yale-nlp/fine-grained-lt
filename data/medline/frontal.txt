These are diseases in which the cells of the brain stop working or die. They include:Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia among older people. People with Alzheimer's have plaques and tangles in their brain. These are abnormal buildups of different proteins. Beta-amyloid protein clumps up and forms plaques in between your brain cells. Tau protein builds up and forms tangles inside the nerve cells of your brain. There is also a loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain.Lewy body dementia, which causes movement symptoms along with dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein in the brain.Frontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain:
	Changes in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptomsChanges in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders
Vascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain.Mixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.Other conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including:Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorderHuntington's disease, an inherited, progressive brain diseaseChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injuryHIV-associated dementia (HAD)Who is at risk for dementia?Certain factors can raise your risk for developing dementia, including:Aging.
