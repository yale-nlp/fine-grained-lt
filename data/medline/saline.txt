Sinusitis means your sinuses are inflamed. The cause can be an infection or another problem. Your sinuses are hollow air spaces within the bones surrounding the nose. They produce mucus, which drains into the nose.  If your nose is swollen, this can block the sinuses and cause pain.There are several types of sinusitis, including:Acute, which lasts up to 4 weeksSubacute, which lasts 4 to 12 weeksChronic, which lasts more than 12 weeks and can continue for months or even yearsRecurrent, with several attacks within a yearAcute sinusitis often starts as a cold, which then turns into a bacterial infection.  Allergies, nasal problems, and certain diseases can also cause acute and chronic sinusitis.Symptoms of sinusitis can include fever, weakness, fatigue, cough, and congestion. There may also be mucus drainage in the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. Your health care professional diagnoses sinusitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your nose and face. You may also need imaging tests. Treatments include antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. Using heat pads on the inflamed area, saline nasal sprays, and vaporizers can also help.
