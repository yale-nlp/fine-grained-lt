Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all. They include:Pain in your neck or backNumbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in your arms or legsPain going down the legFoot problemsDoctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests.
